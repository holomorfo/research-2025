    "name": "A Confidence Measure For Key Labelling",
    "description": "We present a new measure for automatically estimating the confidence of musical key classification. Our approach leverages the degree of harmonic information held within a musical audio signal (its \"keyness\") as well as the steadiness of local key detections across the its duration (its \"stability\"). Using this confidence measure, musical tracks which are likely to be misclassified, i.e. those with low confidence, can then be handled differently from those analysed by standard, fully automatic key detection methods. By means of a listening test, we demonstrate that our developed features significantly correlate with listeners' ratings of harmonic complexity, steadiness and the uniqueness of key. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tracks which are incorrectly labelled using an existing key detection system obtain low confidence values. Finally, we introduce a new method called \"root note heuristics\" for the special treatment of tracks with low confidence. We show that by applying these root note heuristics, key detection results can be improved for minimalistic music.",

    "name": "Improved Chord Recognition by Combining Duration and Harmonic Language Models",
    "description": "Chord recognition systems typically comprise an acoustic model that predicts chords for each audio frame, and a temporal model that casts these predictions into labelled chord segments. However, temporal models have been shown to only smooth predictions, without being able to incorporate musical information about chord progressions. Recent research discovered that it might be the low hierarchical level such models have been applied to (directly on audio frames) which prevents learning musical relationships, even for expressive models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, if applied on the level of chord sequences, RNNs indeed can become powerful chord predictors. In this paper, we disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model\u2014to be applied on chord sequences\u2014and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level predictions of the language model to the frame-level predictions of the acoustic model. In our experiments, we explore the impact of each model on the chord recognition score, and show that using harmonic language and duration models improves the results.",

    "description": "Recent research on Automatic Chord Extraction (ACE) has focused on the improvement of models based on machine learning. However, most models still fail to take into account the prior knowledge underlying the labeling alphabets (chord labels). Furthermore, recent works have shown that ACE performances have reached a glass ceiling. Therefore, this prompts the need to focus on other aspects of the task, such as the introduction of musical knowledge in the representation, the improvement of the models towards more complex chord alphabets and the development of more adapted evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose to exploit specific properties and relationships between chord labels in order to improve the learning of statistical ACE models. Hence, we analyze the interdependence of the representations of chords and their associated distances, the precision of the chord alphabets, and the impact of performing alphabet reduction before or after training the model. Furthermore, we propose new training losses based on musical theory. We show that these improve the results of ACE systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks. By analyzing our results, we uncover a set of related insights on ACE tasks based on statistical models, and also formalize the musical meaning of some classification errors.",

    "name": "A Predictive Model for Music based on Learned Interval Representations",
    "description": "Connectionist sequence models (e.g., RNNs) applied to musical sequences suffer from two known problems: First, they have strictly \"absolute pitch perception\". Therefore, they fail to generalize over musical concepts which are commonly perceived in terms of relative distances between pitches (e.g., melodies, scale types, modes, cadences, or chord types). Second, they fall short of capturing the concepts of repetition and musical form. In this paper we introduce the recurrent gated autoencoder (RGAE), a recurrent neural network which learns and operates on interval representations of musical sequences. The relative pitch modeling increases generalization and reduces sparsity in the input data. Furthermore, it can learn sequences of copy-and-shift operations (i.e. chromatically transposed copies of musical fragments)\u2014a promising capability for learning musical repetition structure. We show that the RGAE improves the state of the art for general connectionist sequence models in learning to predict monophonic melodies, and that ensembles of relative and absolute music processing models improve the results appreciably. Furthermore, we show that the relative pitch processing of the RGAE naturally facilitates the learning and the generation of sequences of copy-and-shift operations, wherefore the RGAE greatly outperforms a common absolute pitch recurrent neural network on this task.",

    "description": "In this work, we present an end-to-end framework for audio-to-score transcription. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic music transcription approach which obtains directly a symbolic score from audio, instead of performing separate stages for piano-roll estimation (pitch detection and note tracking), meter detection or key estimation. The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network architecture directly trained with pairs of spectrograms and their corresponding symbolic scores in Western notation. Unlike standard pitch estimation methods, the proposed architecture does not need the music symbols to be aligned with their audio frames thanks to a Connectionist Temporal Classification loss function. Training and evaluation were performed using a large dataset of short monophonic scores (incipits) from the RISM collection, that were synthesized to get the ground-truth data. Although there is still room for improvement, most musical symbols were correctly detected and the evaluation results validate the proposed approach. We believe that this end-to-end framework opens new avenues for automatic music transcription.",

    "description": "Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is an important task in music information retrieval. Prior work has focused on multiple fundamental frequency estimation (multi-pitch detection), the conversion of an audio signal into a timefrequency representation such as a MIDI file. It is less common to annotate this output with musical features such as voicing information, metrical structure, and harmonic information, though these are important aspects of a complete transcription. Evaluation of these features is most often performed separately and independent of multi-pitch detection; however, these features are non-independent. We therefore introduce M V 2H, a quantitative, automatic, joint evaluation metric based on musicological principles, and show its effectiveness through the use of specific examples. The metric is modularised in such a way that it can still be used with partially performed annotation\u2014 for example, when the transcription process has been applied to some transduced format such as MIDI (which may itself be the result of multi-pitch detection).

Our model predicts pitch onset events and then uses those predictions to condition framewise pitch predictions. During inference, we restrict the predictions from the framewise detector by not allowing a new note to start unless the onset detector also agrees that an onset for that pitch is present in the frame. We focus on improving onsets and offsets together instead of either in isolation as we believe this correlates better with human musical perception. Our approach results in over a 100% relative improvement in note F1 score (with offsets) on the MAPS dataset. Furthermore, we extend the model to predict relative velocities of normalized audio which results in more natural-sounding transcriptions.",

    "description": "State-of-the-art automatic drum transcription (ADT) approaches utilise deep learning methods reliant on timeconsuming manual annotations and require congruence between training and testing data. When these conditions are not held, they often fail to generalise. We propose a game approach to ADT, termed player vs transcriber (PvT), in which a player model aims to reduce transcription accuracy of a transcriber model by manipulating training data in two ways. First, existing data may be augmented, allowing the transcriber to be trained using recordings with modified timbres. Second, additional individual recordings from sample libraries are included to generate rare combinations. We present three versions of the PvT model: AugExist, which augments pre-existing recordings; AugAddExist, which adds additional samples of drum hits to the AugExist system; and Generate, which generates training examples exclusively from individual drum hits from sample libraries. The three versions are evaluated alongside a state-of-the-art deep learning ADT system using two evaluation strategies. The results demonstrate that including the player network improves the ADT performance and suggests that this is due to improved generalisability. The results also indicate that although the Generate model achieves relatively low results, it is a viable choice when annotations are not accessible.",

    "description": "Despite being a core component of Western music theory, harmonic analysis remains a subjective endeavor, resistant automation. This subjectivity arises from disagreements regarding, among other things, the interpretation of contrapuntal figures, the set of \"legal\" harmonies, and how harmony relates to more abstract features like tonal function. In this paper, we provide a formal specification of harmonic analysis. We then present a novel approach to computational harmonic analysis: rather than computing harmonic analyses based on one specific set of rules, we compute all possible analyses which satisfy only basic, uncontroversial constraints. These myriad interpretations can later be filtered to extract preferred analyses; for instance, to forbid 7th chords or to prefer analyses with fewer non-chord tones. We apply this approach to two concrete musical datasets: existing encodings of 371 chorales by J.S. Bach and new encodings of 200 chorales by M. Pr\u00e6torius. Through an online API users can filter and download numerous harmonic interpretations of these 571 chorales. This dataset will serve as a useful resource in the study of harmonic/functional progression, voice-leading, and the relationship between melody and harmony, and as a stepping stone towards automated harmonic analysis of more complex music.",

We approach the task from a classification perspective and adopt a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture that relies on a particular form of pretraining by source-filter nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF). The source-filter NMF decomposition is chosen for its ability to capture the pitch and timbre content of the leading voice/instrument, providing a better initial pitch salience than standard timefrequency representations. Starting from such a musically motivated representation, we propose to further enhance the NMF-based salience representations with CNN layers, then to model the temporal structure by an RNN network and to estimate the dominant melody with a final classification layer. The results show that such a system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MedleyDB dataset without any augmentation methods or large training sets.",

Experimental results highlight the capability of the proposed recognition system, and a promising improvement of the system by employing multi-task learning instead of single-task learning.

Contrary to existing systems, which typically first identify onsets or beats and then derive a tempo, our system estimates the tempo directly from a conventional melspectrogram in a single step. This is achieved by framing tempo estimation as a multi-class classification problem using a network architecture that is inspired by conventional approaches. The system's CNN has been trained with the union of three datasets covering a large variety of genres and tempi using problem-specific data augmentation techniques. Two of the three ground-truths are novel and will be released for research purposes. As input the system requires only 11.9 s of audio and is therefore suitable for local as well as global tempo estimation. When used as a global estimator, it performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art algorithms. Especially the exact estimation of tempo without tempo octave confusion is significantly improved. As local estimator it can be used to identify and visualize tempo drift in musical performances.",

We study the effects of the temporal granularity of the input representation (i.e. beat-level vs tatum-level) and the encoding of the networks outputs. We also investigate the potential of convolutional-recurrent networks, which have not been explored in previous downbeat tracking systems. To this end, we exploit a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network where we introduce those variants, while keeping the training data, network learning parameters and postprocessing stages fixed.

To this end, we separate individual notes of polyphonic piano music using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and feed them into a neural network that is trained to discriminate the timbre change according to the key velocity. Combining the note intensity from the separated notes with the statistics of the neural network prediction, the proposed method estimates the key velocity in the dimension of MIDI note velocity.

In this study, we applied an adaptive procedure to investigate the effect of musical training on individual thresholds for instrument identification. A timbre discrimination task consisting of a 4-alternative forced choice (4AFC) of brief instrument sounds with varying duration was assigned to 16 test subjects using an adaptive staircase method. The effect of musical training has been investigated by dividing the participants into two groups: musicians and non-musicians. The experiment showed lowest thresholds for the guitar sound and highest for the violin sound, with a high overall performance level, but no significant difference between the two groups. It is suggested that the test subjects adjust the weightings of the perceptual dimensions of timbre according to different degrees of acoustic degradation of the stimuli, which are evaluated both by plotting extracted audio features in a feature space and by considering the timbral specificities of the four instruments.",

Another problem is developing an interactive GUI that enables a user to partially update chords and melodies by considering the latent tree structure of music. To solve these problems, we propose a hierarchical generative model consisting of (1) a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) for chord symbols, (2) a metrical Markov model for chord boundaries, (3) a Markov model for melody pitches, and (4) a metrical Markov model for melody onsets. The harmonic functions (syntactic roles) and repetitive structure of chords are learned by the PCFG. Any variables specified by a user can be optimized or sampled in a principled manner according to a unified posterior distribution. For improved melodization, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network can also be used. The subjective experimental result showed the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

At the present, models of harmonic syntax face challenges on the tasks of detecting local and higher-level modulations (most previous models assume a priori knowledge of key), computing connected parse trees for long sequences, and parsing sequences that do not end with tonic chords, but in turnarounds. This paper addresses those problems by proposing a new generative formalism Probabilistic Abstract Context-Free Grammars (PACFGs) to address these issues, and presents variants of standard parsing algorithms that efficiently enumerate all possible parses of long chord sequences and to estimate their probabilities. PACFGs specifically allow for structured non-terminal symbols in rich and highly flexible feature spaces. The inference procedure moreover takes advantage of these abstractions by sharing probability mass between grammar rules over joint features. The paper presents a model of the harmonic syntax of Jazz using this formalism together with stochastic variational inference to learn the probabilistic parameters of a grammar from a corpus of Jazz-standards. The PACFG model outperforms the standard context-free approach while reducing the number of free parameters and performing key finding on the fly.",

However, as the learning is unsupervised, the latent dimensions are not related to perceptual properties. In parallel, music perception research has aimed to understand timbre based on human dissimilarity ratings. These lead to timbre spaces which exhibit perceptual similarities between sounds. However, they do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can bridge these lines of research and alleviate their weaknesses by regularizing the latent spaces to match perceptual distances collected from timbre studies. Hence, we propose three types of regularization and show that they lead to spaces that are simultaneously coherent with signal properties and perceptual similarities. We show that these spaces can be used for efficient audio classification. We study how audio descriptors are organized along the latent dimensions and show that even though descriptors behave in a non-linear way across the space, they still exhibit a locally smooth evolution. We also show that, as this space generalizes to novel samples, it can be used to predict perceptual similarities of novel instruments. Finally, we exhibit the generative capabilities of our spaces, that can directly synthesize sounds with continuous evolution of timbre perception.",

Raw audio models, such as DeepMind's WaveNet, train directly on sampled audio waveforms, allowing them to produce realistic-sounding, albeit unstructured music. In this paper, we propose an automatic music generation methodology combining both of these approaches to create structured, realistic-sounding compositions. We consider a Long Short Term Memory network to learn the melodic structure of different styles of music, and then use the unique symbolic generations from this model as a conditioning input to a WaveNet-based raw audio generator, creating a model for automatic, novel music.

However, existing models can only generate real-valued piano-rolls and require further post-processing, such as hard thresholding (HT) or Bernoulli sampling (BS), to obtain the final binaryvalued results. In this paper, we study whether we can have a convolutional GAN model that directly creates binaryvalued piano-rolls by using binary neurons. Specifically, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which uses binary neurons at the output layer. The whole network is trained in two stages. Firstly, the generator and the discriminator are pretrained. Then, the refiner network is trained along with the discriminator to learn to binarize the real-valued piano-rolls the pretrained generator creates. Experimental results show that using binary neurons instead of HT or BS indeed leads to better results in a number of objective measures.

Existing approaches, however, are mostly ad hoc to specific rhythmic structures or instrumentation layouts, and lack music-theoretic rigor in their evaluations. In this paper, we present a neural language (music) model that tries to model symbolic multi-part music. Our model is part-invariant, i.e., it can process/generate any part (voice) of a music score consisting of an arbitrary number of parts, using a single trained model. For better incorporating structural information of pitch spaces, we use a structured embedding matrix to encode multiple aspects of a pitch into a vector representation. The generation is performed by Gibbs Sampling. Meanwhile, our model directly generates note spellings to make outputs human-readable. We performed objective (grading) and subjective (listening) evaluations by recruiting music theorists to compare the outputs of our algorithm with those of music students on the task of bassline harmonization (a traditional pedagogical task). Our experiment shows that errors of our algorithm and students are differently distributed, and the range of ratings for generated pieces overlaps with students' to varying extents for our three provided basslines. This experiment suggests some future research directions.",

    "name": "Evaluating Language Models of Tonal Harmony",
    "description": "This study borrows and extends probabilistic language models from natural language processing to discover the syntactic properties of tonal harmony. Language models come in many shapes and sizes, but their central purpose is always the same: to predict the next event in a sequence of letters, words, notes, or chords. However, few studies employing such models have evaluated the most stateof-the-art architectures using a large-scale corpus of Western tonal music, instead preferring to use relatively small datasets containing chord annotations from contemporary genres like jazz, pop, and rock. Using symbolic representations of prominent instrumental genres from the common-practice period, this study applies a flexible, data-driven encoding scheme to (1) evaluate Finite Context (or n-gram) models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a chord prediction task; (2) compare predictive accuracy from the best-performing models for chord onsets from each of the selected datasets; and (3) explain differences between the two model architectures in a regression analysis. We find that Finite Context models using the Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) algorithm outperform RNNs, particularly for the piano datasets, with the regression model suggesting that RNNs struggle with particularly rare chord types.",

Experiments show that (a) incorporation of metric information yields in 4% smaller error, (b) the model is capable of learning the motion behavior of a specific player, and (c) no significant difference between the generated and real human movements is observed by human subjects in 75% of the pieces.",

We show that a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation combined with a trivial detector already establishes a high baseline for this task, and we propose tricks that further improve detection performance: training against convex hulls of symbol masks, and multichannel output models that enable feature sharing for semantically related symbols. The latter is helpful especially for clefs, which have severe impacts on the overall OMR result. We then integrate the networks into an OMR pipeline by applying a subsequent notation assembly stage, establishing a new baseline result for pitch inference in handwritten music at an f-score of 0.81. Given the automatically inferred pitches we run retrieval experiments on handwritten scores, providing first empirical evidence that utilizing the powerful image processing models brings content-based search in large musical manuscript archives within reach.",

    "description": "We define three retrieval tasks requiring efficient search of the musical content of a collection of ~32k pageimages of 16th-century music to find: duplicates; pages with the same musical content; pages of related music. The images are subjected to Optical Music Recognition (OMR), introducing inevitable errors. We encode pages as strings of diatonic pitch intervals, ignoring rests, to reduce the effect of such errors. We extract indices comprising lists of two kinds of 'word'. Approximate matching is done by counting the number of common words between a query page and those in the collection. The two word-types are (a) normal ngrams and (b) minimal absent words (MAWs). The latter have three important properties for our purpose: they can be built and searched in linear time, the number of MAWs generated tends to be smaller, and they preserve the structure and order of the text, obviating the need for expensive sorting operations. We show that retrieval performance of MAWs is comparable with ngrams, but with a marked speed improvement. We also show the effect of word length on retrieval. Our results suggest that an index of MAWs of mixed length provides a good method for these tasks which is scalable to larger collections.",

However, these approaches have been evaluated on images with ideal conditions, which do not correspond to the previous scenario. In this work, we evaluate the performance of an end-to-end approach that uses a deep convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) over non-ideal image conditions of music scores. Consequently, our contribution also consists of Camera-PrIMuS, a corpus of printed monophonic scores of real music synthetically modified to resemble camera-based realistic scenarios, involving distortions such as irregular lighting, rotations, or blurring.

In this paper, we propose the use of a set of deep selectional auto-encoders, implemented as fully-convolutional networks, to perform image-to-image categorizations. This strategy retains the advantages of using deep neural networks, which have demonstrated their ability to perform this task, while dramatically increasing the efficiency by processing a large number of pixels in a single step. The results of an experiment performed with a set of high-resolution images taken from Medieval manuscripts successfully validate this approach, with a similar accuracy to that of the state of the art but with a computational time orders of magnitude smaller, making this approach appropriate for being used in interactive applications.",

For tasks that include framewise binary classification (e.g., onset detection, music transcription) classes are derived from output activation functions by identifying points of local maxima, or peaks. However, the operating principles behind peak picking are different to that of the cross entropy loss function, which minimises the absolute difference between the output and target values for a single frame. To generate activation functions more suited to peak-picking, we propose two versions of a new loss function that incorporates information from multiple time-steps: 1) multi-individual, which uses multiple individual time-step cross entropies; and 2) multi-difference, which directly compares the difference between sequential time-step outputs. We evaluate the newly proposed loss functions alongside standard cross entropy in the popular MIR tasks of onset detection and automatic drum transcription. The results highlight the effectiveness of these loss functions in the improvement of overall system accuracies for both MIR tasks. Additionally, directly comparing the output from sequential time-steps in the multidifference approach achieves the highest performance.",

In contrast to four other methods \u2013 data augmentation, instance normalization, spectral delta features, and per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) \u2013 that we evaluated on a largescale public dataset, zero-mean convolutions achieve perfect sound level invariance without any impact on prediction accuracy or computational requirements.

In this context, we propose the Wave-U-Net, an adaptation of the U-Net to the one-dimensional time domain, which repeatedly resamples feature maps to compute and combine features at different time scales. We introduce further architectural improvements, including an output layer that enforces source additivity, an upsampling technique and a context-aware prediction framework to reduce output artifacts.

One dataset contains multichannel EEG of subjects listening to and imagining rhythmical patterns presented both as sine wave tones and short looped spoken utterances. These utterances leverage the well-known speech-to-song illusory transformation which results in very catchy and easy to reproduce motifs. A second dataset provides EEG recordings for the perception of 10 full length songs. Using a multi-view deep generative model we demonstrate the feasibility of learning a shared latent representation of brain activity and auditory concepts, such as rhythmical motifs appearing across different instrumentations. Introspection of the model trained on the rhythm dataset reveals disentangled rhythmical and timbral features within and across subjects. The model allows continuous interpolation between representations of different observed variants of the presented stimuli. By decoding the learned embeddings we were able to reconstruct both perceived and imagined music. Stimulus complexity and the choice of training data shows strong effect on the reconstruction quality.",

    "description": "For musicological studies on large corpora, the compilation of suitable data constitutes a time-consuming step. In particular, this is true for high-quality symbolic representations that are generated manually in a tedious process. A recent study on Western classical music has shown that musical phenomena such as the evolution of tonal complexity over history can also be analyzed on the basis of audio recordings. As our first contribution, we transfer this corpus analysis method to jazz music using the Weimar Jazz Database, which contains high-level symbolic transcriptions of jazz solos along with the audio recordings. Second, we investigate the influence of the input representation type on the corpus-level observations. In our experiments, all representation types led to qualitatively similar results. We conclude that audio recordings can build a reasonable basis for conducting such type of corpus analysis.",

    "description": "The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce DALI, a large and rich multimodal dataset containing 5358 audio tracks with their time-aligned vocal melody notes and lyrics at four levels of granularity. The second goal is to explain our methodology where dataset creation and learning models interact using a teacher-student machine learning paradigm that benefits each other. We start with a set of manual annotations of draft time-aligned lyrics and notes made by non-expert users of Karaoke games. This set comes without audio. Therefore, we need to find the corresponding audio and adapt the annotations to it. To that end, we retrieve audio candidates from the Web. Each candidate is then turned into a singing-voice probability over time using a teacher, a deep convolutional neural network singing-voice detection system (SVD), trained on cleaned data. Comparing the time-aligned lyrics and the singing-voice probability, we detect matches and update the time-alignment lyrics accordingly. From this, we obtain new audio sets. They are then used to train new SVD students used to perform again the above comparison. The process could be repeated iteratively. We show that this allows to progressively improve the performances of our SVD and get better audiomatching and alignment.",

However, with the increasing popularity of data-hungry approaches such as deep learning, the insufficient amount of data becomes more and more a challenge that concerns the generality of the resulting models and the validity of the evaluation. To address this challenge in ADT, this paper first examines the existing labeled datasets and how representative they are of the research problem. Next, possibilities of using unlabeled data to improve general ADT systems are explored. Specifically, two paradigms that harness information from unlabeled data, namely feature learning and student-teacher learning, are applied to two major types of ADT systems. All systems are evaluated on four different drum datasets. The results highlight the necessity of more and larger annotated datasets and indicate the feasibility of exploiting unlabeled data for improving ADT systems.",

    "description": "The creation of a corpus of compositions in symbolic formats is an essential step for any project in systematic research. There are, however, many potential pitfalls, especially in early music, where scores are edited in different ways: variables include clefs, note values, types of barline, and editorial accidentals. Different score editors and optical music recognition software have their own ways of storing and exporting musical data. Choice of software and file formats, and their various parameters, can thus unintentionally bias data, as can decisions on how to interpret potentially ambiguous markings in original sources. This becomes especially problematic when data from different corpora are combined for computational processing, since observed regularities and irregularities may in fact be linked with inconsistent corpus collection methodologies, internal and external, rather than the underlying music. This paper proposes guidelines, templates, and workflows for the creation of consistent early music corpora, and for detecting encoding biases in existing corpora. We have assembled a corpus of Renaissance duos as a sample implementation, and present machine learning experiments demonstrating how inconsistent or na\u00efve encoding methodologies for corpus collection can distort results.",

The stationary points (STAs) of transients \u2013 points where the pitch curve changes direction \u2013 also carry melody information. In this paper, the precision of sung notes in Carnatic music is studied in detail by treating CPNs and STAs separately. There is variation among the nineteen musicians considered, but on average, the precision of CPNs increases exponentially with duration and settles at about 10 cents for CPNs longer than 0.5 seconds. For analyzing STAs, in contrast to Western music, r\u00afaga (melody) information is found to be necessary, and errors in STAs show a significantly larger standard deviation of about 60 cents. To corroborate these observations, the music was automatically transcribed and re-synthesized using CPN and STA information using two interpolation techniques. The results of perceptual tests clearly indicate that the grammar is highly flexible. We also show that the precision errors are not due to poor pitch tracking, singer deficiencies or delay in auditory feedback.",

We address two questions: (1) what components of music are most salient to people's musical taste, and (2) how do vocals rank relative to other components of music, in regards to whether people like or dislike a song. Lastly, we explore the aspects of the voice that listeners find important. Two surveys of Spotify users were conducted. The first gathered open-format responses that were then card-sorted into semantic categories by the team of researchers. The second asked respondents to rank the semantic categories derived from the first survey. Responses indicate that vocals were a salient component in the minds of listeners. Further, vocals ranked high as a self-reported factor for a listener liking or disliking a track, among a statistically significant ranking of musical attributes.

Such an approach can benefit from a signal processing method that helps to enhance the true pitch contours on an image, and, a music language model with structural information on large-scale symbolic music data to be transfer into an audio-based model. In this paper, we propose a novel melody extraction system, using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with dilated convolution as the semantic segmentation tool. The candidate pitch contours on the time-frequency image are enhanced by combining the spectrogram and cepstral-based features. Moreover, an adaptive progressive neural network is employed to transfer the semantic segmentation model in the symbolic domain to the one in the audio domain. This paper makes an attempt to bridge the semantic gaps between signal-level features and perceived melodies, and between symbolic data and audio data.

This work explores the importance of four cognitive decision-making factors (familiarity, genre preference, ease of vocal reproducibility, and overall preference) influence in the perception of \"singability\", how attractive a song is to sing. In Experiment One, we develop a model to validate and empirically determine to what degree these factors are important when evaluating its singability. Results indicate that evaluations of how these four factors impact singability strongly correlate with pairwise evaluations (\u03c1 = 0.692, p < 0.0001), supporting the notion that singability is a measurable cognitive process. Experiment Two examines the degree to which timbral and rhythmic features contribute to singability. Regression and random forest analysis find that some selected features are more significant than others. We discuss the method we use to empirically assess the complex decisions, and provide a preliminary exploration regarding what acoustic features may motivate these choices.",

Human-annotated patterns have been collected and used to evaluate pattern discovery algorithms, e.g., in the Discovery of Repeated Themes & Sections MIREX task. However, state-of-the-art algorithms are not yet able to reproduce human-annotated patterns. To understand what gives rise to the discrepancy between algorithmically extracted patterns and human-annotated patterns, we use jSymbolic\uf732 to extract features from patterns, visualise the feature space using PCA and perform a comparative analysis using classification techniques. We show that it is possible to classify algorithmically extracted patterns, human-annotated patterns and randomly sampled passages. This implies: (a) Algorithmically extracted patterns possess different properties than human-annotated patterns (b) Algorithmically extracted patterns have different structures than randomly sampled passages (c) Human-annotated patterns contain more information than randomly sampled passages despite subjectivity involved in the annotation process. We further discover that rhythmic features are of high importance in the classification process, which should influence future research on automatic pattern discovery.",

    "description": "The discovery of patterns using a minimal set of assumptions constitutes a central challenge in the modeling of polyphonic music and complex streams in general. Skipgrams have been found to be a powerful model for capturing semi-local dependencies in sequences of entities when dependencies may not be directly adjacent (see, for instance, the problems of modeling sequences of words or letters in computational linguistics). Since common skipgrams define locality based on indices, they can only be applied to a single stream of non-overlapping entities. This paper proposes a generalized skipgram model that allows arbitrary cost functions (defining locality), efficient filtering, recursive application (skipgrams over skipgrams), and memory efficient streaming. Further, a sampling mechanism is proposed that flexibly controls runtime and output size. These generalizations and optimizations make it possible to employ skipgrams for the discovery of repeated patterns of close, nonsimultaneous events or notes. The extensions to the skipgram model provided here do not only apply to musical notes but to any list of entities that is monotonic with respect to a given cost function.",

Users can utilize three functions. First, they can browse musical pieces on a map by referring to the visualized instrumentation. Second, they can interactively edit a playlist that showing the items to be played later. Finally, they can discern the temporal changes in instrumentation and skip to a preferable part of a piece with a multi-colored graph.

First, a human listening test shows that 73.32% of our automatically aligned sentence-level transcriptions are correct. Second, the automatically aligned sung segments are used for singing acoustic model adaptation, which reduces the word error rate (WER) of automatic transcription of sung lyrics from 72.08% to 37.15% in an open test. Third, another iteration of decoding and model adaptation increases the amount of reliably decoded segments from 44.40% to 91.96% and further reduces the WER to 36.32%.

    "description": "Musical features and descriptors could be coarsely divided into three levels of complexity. The bottom level contains the basic building blocks of music, e.g., chords, beats and timbre. The middle level contains concepts that emerge from combining the basic blocks: tonal and rhythmic stability, harmonic and rhythmic complexity, etc. High-level descriptors (genre, mood, expressive style) are usually modeled using the lower level ones. The features belonging to the middle level can both improve automatic recognition of high-level descriptors, and provide new music retrieval possibilities. Mid-level features are subjective and usually lack clear definitions. However, they are very important for human perception of music, and on some of them people can reach high agreement, even though defining them and therefore, designing a hand-crafted feature extractor for them can be difficult. In this paper, we derive the mid-level descriptors from data. We collect and release a dataset 1 of 5000 songs annotated by musicians with seven mid-level descriptors, namely, melodiousness, tonal and rhythmic stability, modality, rhythmic complexity, dissonance and articulation. We then compare several approaches to predicting these descriptors from spectrograms using deep-learning.

We also propose a new negative sampling method for metric learning that takes advantage of side information such as music genre during the learning phase and shows promising results for the artist clustering task.",

    "description": "Recordings of a cappella music often exhibit significant pitch drift. This drift may accumulate over time to a total transposition of several semitones, which renders the canonical 2-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) useless. We propose Transposition-Aware Dynamic Time Warping (TA-DTW), an approach that introduces a 3rd dimension to DTW. Steps in this dimension represent changes in transposition. Paired with suitable input features, TA-DTW computes an optimal alignment path between a symbolic score and a corresponding audio recording in the presence of pitch drift or arbitrary transpositions.",

Our work focuses on studying how these two types of deep architectures perform when datasets of variable size are available for training: the MagnaTagATune (25k songs), the Million Song Dataset (240k songs), and a private dataset of 1.2M songs. Our experiments suggest that music domain assumptions are relevant when not enough training data are available, thus showing how waveform-based models outperform spectrogrambased ones in large-scale data scenarios.",

    "description": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of domain-adaptive representation learning for music processing. Domain adaptation is an approach aiming to eliminate the distributional discrepancy of the modeling data, so as to transfer learnable knowledge from one domain to another. With its great success in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, domain adaptation also shows great potential in music processing, for music is essentially a highly-structured semantic system having domaindependent information. Our proposed model contains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the training data into a latent space, and the resulting latent representations along with its model parameters are then reused to regularize the representation learning of the downstream task where the data are in the other domain. The experiments on cross-domain music alignment, namely an audioto-MIDI alignment, and a monophonic-to-polyphonic music alignment of singing voice show that the learned representations lead to better higher alignment accuracy than that using conventional features. Furthermore, a preliminary experiment on singing voice source separation, by regarding the mixture and the voice as two distinct domains, also demonstrates the capability to solve music processing problems from the perspective of domain-adaptive representation learning.",

    "description": "Many music theoretical constructs (such as scale types, modes, cadences, and chord types) are defined in terms of pitch intervals\u2014relative distances between pitches. Therefore, when computer models are employed in music tasks, it can be useful to operate on interval representations rather than on the raw musical surface. Moreover, interval representations are transposition-invariant, valuable for tasks like audio alignment, cover song detection and music structure analysis. We employ a gated autoencoder to learn fixed-length, invertible and transposition-invariant interval representations from polyphonic music in the symbolic domain and in audio. An unsupervised training method is proposed yielding an organization of intervals in the representation space which is musically plausible. Based on the representations, a transposition-invariant self-similarity matrix is constructed and used to determine repeated sections in symbolic music and in audio, yielding competitive results in the MIREX task \"Discovery of Repeated Themes and Sections\".",

Based on the user data, we created a model of these practices and influences that provides a lens through which social experiences surrounding commercial music services can be understood. An understanding of these social practices within their contextual ecosystem help inform what influences should be considered when designing new technologies. Our findings include the identification of: the underlying relationships between practices and their influences; practices and influences that inform the weight of relationships in social networks; social norms to be considered when designing social features; influences that add additional insight to previously observed behaviors; and a detailed explanation of how music selection and listening practices can be supported by commercial music services.",

Even if she does not input such information, it has been reported that user attributes can be predicted with high accuracy by using her play log. How can users enjoy music when using an online music service while preserving their demographic anonymity? To solve this problem, we propose a system called Listener Anonymizer. Listener Anonymizer monitors the user's play log. When it detects that her confidential attributes can be predicted, it selects songs that can decrease the prediction accuracy and recommends them to her. The user can camouflage her play logs by playing these songs to preserve her demographic anonymity. Since such songs do not always match her music taste, selecting as few songs as possible that can effectively anonymize her attributes is required. Listener Anonymizer realizes this by selecting songs based on feature ablation analysis. Our experimental results using Last.fm play logs showed that Listener Anonymizer was able to preserve anonymity with fewer songs than a method that randomly selected songs.",

For this purpose, we devised an experiment in which people drove a simulated car through an intersection while listening to music. The intersection was not empty, as another simulated vehicle, controlled autonomously, was also crossing the intersection in a different direction.

We use both well-established algorithms, such as BiRank, and a modification of their common iterative scheme that avoids the impact of possibly erroneous heuristics to the ranking, which we call VenueRank. Resulting venue ranks are compared to those obtained from feature extraction for predicting the most listened artists and large listener increments in Spotify.

To this end, the musical preferences of users in the context of music recommender systems have mostly been captured in collaborative filtering-based approaches. Alternatively, users can be characterized by their average listening behavior and hence, by the mean values of a set of content descriptors of tracks the users listened to. However, a user may listen to highly different tracks and genres. Thus, computing the average of all tracks does not capture the user's listening behavior well. We argue that each user may have many different preferences that depend on contextual aspects (e.g., listening to classical music when working and hard rock when doing sports) and that user models should account for these different sets of preferences. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis and evaluation of different user models that describe a user's musical preferences based on acoustic features of tracks the user has listened to.",

However, finding discriminative features in an unsupervised way is challenging and supervised feature learning using semantic labels may involve noisy or expensive annotation. In this paper, we present a supervised feature learning approach using artist labels annotated in every single track as objective meta data. We propose two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to learn the deep artist features. One is a plain DCNN trained with the whole artist labels simultaneously, and the other is a Siamese DCNN trained with a subset of the artist labels based on the artist identity. We apply the trained models to music classification and retrieval tasks in transfer learning settings. The results show that our approach is comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods, indicating that the proposed approach captures general music audio features as much as the models learned with semantic labels.

At the same, the recent growth of digital music repositories makes necessary the development of novel time- and memory-efficient algorithms to deal with music data. One particularly interesting idea on the literature is transforming the music data into reduced representations, improving the memory usage and reducing the time necessary to assess the similarity. However, these techniques usually add other issues, such as an expensive preprocessing or a reduced retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method to summarize a recording in small snippets based on its self-similarity information. Besides, we present a simple way to compare other recordings to these summaries. We demonstrate, in the scenario of cover song identification, that our method is more than one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art adversaries, at the same time that the retrieval performance is not affected significantly. Additionally, our method is incremental, which allows the easy and fast update of the database when a new song needs to be inserted into the retrieval system.",

The results suggest that the deepest fully connected layer of the model does not preserve temporal and harmonic structures, but that the inverted features from the deepest convolutional layer do.

Most current approaches compute the similarity between two melodic sequences by comparing their local features (distance between pitches, intervals, etc.) or by comparing the sequences after aligning them. In order to find a better feature representing global characteristics of a melody, we propose to represent the melodic sequence of each musical piece by the parameters of a generative Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on its sequence. Because the trained RNN can generate the identical melodic sequence of each piece, we can expect that the RNN parameters contain the temporal information within the melody. In our experiment, we first train an RNN on all melodic sequences, and then use it as an initialisation to train an individual RNN on each melodic sequence. The similarity between two melodies is computed by using the distance between their individual RNN parameters. Experimental results showed that the proposed RNN-based similarity outperformed the baseline similarity obtained by directly comparing melodic sequences.",

In particular, we design multimodal RL agents that simultaneously learn to listen to music, read the scores from images of sheet music, and follow the audio along in the sheet, in an end-to-end fashion. All this behavior is learned entirely from scratch, based on a weak and potentially delayed reward signal that indicates to the agent how close it is to the correct position in the score.

Additionally, it has proven to achieve state-ofthe-art performance while being scalable to big data. Yet, CF suffers from a critical issue, usually called cold-start problem: the system cannot recommend new songs, i.e., songs which have never been listened to. To alleviate this, one should complement the listening counts with another modality. This paper proposes a multi-modal extension of PMF applied to listening counts and tag labels extracted from the Million Song Dataset. In our model, every song is represented by the same activation pattern in each modality but with possibly different scales. As such, the method is not prone to the cold-start problem, i.e., it can learn from a single modality when the other one is not informative.

    "description": "Optical Music Recognition (OMR) promises great benefits to Music Information Retrieval by reducing the costs of making sheet music available in a symbolic format. Recent advances in deep learning have turned typical OMR obstacles into clearly solvable problems, especially the stages that visually process the input image, such as staff line removal or detection of music-notation objects. However, merely detecting objects is not enough for retrieving the actual content, as music notation is a configurational writing system where the semantic of a primitive is defined by its relationship to other primitives. Thus, OMR systems must employ a notation assembly stage to infer such relationships among the detected objects. So far, this stage has been addressed by devising a set of predefined rules or grammars, which hardly generalize well. In this work, we formulate the notation assembly stage from a set of detected primitives as a machine learning problem. Our notation assembly is modeled as a graph that stores syntactic relationships among primitives, which allows us to capture the configuration of symbols in a music-notation document. Our results over the handwritten sheet music corpus MUSCIMA++ show 95.2% precision, 96.0% recall, and an F-score of 95.6% in establishing the correct syntactic relationships. When inferring relationships on data from a music object detector, the model achieves 93.2% precision, 91.5% recall and an F-score of 92.3%.",

    "name": "An Attention Mechanism for Musical Instrument Recognition",
    "description": "While the automatic recognition of musical instruments has seen significant progress, the task is still considered hard for music featuring multiple instruments as opposed to single instrument recordings. Datasets for polyphonic instrument recognition can be categorized into roughly two categories. Some, such as MedleyDB, have strong per-frame instrument activity annotations but are usually small in size. Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song. We explore an attention mechanism for handling weakly labeled data for multi-label instrument recognition. Attention has been found to perform well for other tasks with weakly labeled data. We compare the proposed attention model to multiple models which include a baseline binary relevance random forest, recurrent neural network, and fully connected neural networks. Our results show that incorporating attention leads to an overall improvement in classification accuracy metrics across all 20 instruments in the OpenMIC dataset. We find that attention enables models to focus on (or 'attend to') specific time segments in the audio relevant to each instrument label leading to interpretable results.",

    "description": "MIDI-sheet music alignment is the task of finding correspondences between a MIDI representation of a piece and its corresponding sheet music images. Rather than using optical music recognition to bridge the gap between sheet music and MIDI, we explore an alternative approach: projecting the MIDI data into pixel space and performing alignment in the image domain. Our method converts the MIDI data into a crude representation of the score that only contains rectangular floating notehead blobs, a process we call bootleg score synthesis. Furthermore, we project sheet music images into the same bootleg space by applying a deep watershed notehead detector and filling in the bounding boxes around each detected notehead. Finally, we align the bootleg representations using a simple variant of dynamic time warping. On a dataset of 68 real scanned piano scores from IMSLP and corresponding MIDI performances, our method achieves a 97.3% accuracy at an error tolerance of one second, outperforming several baseline systems that employ optical music recognition.",

However, when it comes to datasets, there is usually little guarantee that researchers are using the exact same data in the same way, which among other issues, makes comparisons of different methods on the \"same\" datasets problematic. In this paper, we first show how (often unknown) differences in datasets can lead to significantly different experimental results. We propose a solution to these problems in the form of an open source library, mirdata, which handles datasets in their current distribution modes, but controls for possible variability. In particular, it contains tools which: (1) validate if the user's data (e.g. audio, annotations) is consistent with a canonical version of the dataset; (2) load annotations in a consistent manner; (3) download or give instructions for obtaining data; and (4) make it easy to perform track metadata-specific analysis.",

    "description": "Automatic cover detection -- the task of finding in an audio database all the covers of one or several query tracks -- has long been seen as a challenging theoretical problem in the MIR community and as an acute practical problem for authors and composers societies. Original algorithms proposed for this task have proven their accuracy on small datasets, but are unable to scale up to modern real-life audio corpora. On the other hand, faster approaches designed to process thousands of pairwise comparisons resulted in lower accuracy, making them unsuitable for practical use. In this work, we propose a neural network architecture that is trained to represent each track as a single embedding vector. The computation burden is therefore left to the embedding extraction -- that can be conducted offline and stored, while the pairwise comparison task reduces to a simple Euclidean distance computation. We further propose to extract each track's embedding out of its dominant melody representation, obtained by another neural network trained for this task. We then show that this architecture improves state-of-the-art accuracy both on small and large datasets, and is able to scale to query databases of thousands of tracks in a few seconds.",

    "description": "Existing kinematic research on orchestral conducting movement contributes to beat-tracking and the delivery of performance dynamics. Methodologically, such movement cues have been treated as distinct, isolated events. Yet as practicing musicians and music pedagogues know, conductors' expressive instructions are highly flexible and dependent on the musical context. We seek to demonstrate an approach to search for effective descriptors to express musical features in conducting movement in a valid music context, and to extract complex expressive semantics from elementary conducting kinematic variations. This study therefore proposes a multi-task learning model to jointly identify dynamic, articulation, and phrasing cues from conducting kinematics. A professional conducting movement dataset is compiled using a high-resolution motion capture system. The ReliefF algorithm is applied to select significant features from conducting movement, and recurrent neural network (RNN) is implemented to identify multiple movement cues. The experimental results disclose key elements in conducting movement which communicate musical expressiveness; the results also highlight the advantage of multi-task learning in the complete musical context over single-task learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use recurrent neural network to explore multiple semantic expressive cuing in conducting movement kinematics.",

Disagreements about these judgments have led to extensive theoretical debates and ongoing controversies. Such debates are exacerbated by the absence of a pubic corpus of expert Roman numeral analyses, and by the more fundamental lack of an agreed-upon, computer-readable syntax in which those analyses might be expressed.

    "description": "In the course of editing musical works, musicologists regularly compare multiple sources of the same musical piece, such as composers' autographs, handwritten copies, and various prints. For efficient comparison, cross-source navigation is essential, enabling to quickly jump back and forth between multiple sources without losing the current musical position. In practice, measures are first annotated by hand in the individual source images and then related to each other. Our approach automates this time-consuming and error-prone process with the help of deep learning. For this purpose, we train a neural network that automatically finds bounding boxes of all measures in images. A second network is trained to compute the similarity between two measures to determine if they have the same musical content and should, therefore, be linked for navigation. Sequences of outputs from the second network are matched using Dynamic Time Warping to provide the final proposal of measure relationships, so-called concordances. In addition to cross-source navigation, the results can be used to spot structural differences across the sources which are essential for editorial work, so that musicologists can focus more on analytical tasks.",

Although there are various systems for music retrieval based on the similarity between songs or artists and for music browsing based on visualized songs, it is still difficult to explore unfamiliar content by flexibly combining multiple musical aspects. Query-by-Blending overcomes this difficulty by representing each of the aspects as a latent vector representation (called a \"flavor\" in this paper) that is a distinctive quality felt to be characteristic of a given word/song/artist. By giving a lyric word as a query, for example, a user can find songs and artists whose flavors are similar to the flavor of the query word. Moreover, by giving a query combining (blending) lyric-word and song-audio flavors, the user can interactively explore unfamiliar content containing the blended flavor. This multi-aspect blending was achieved by constructing a novel vector space model into which all of the lyric words, song audio tracks, and artist IDs of a collection can be embedded. In our experiments, we embedded 14,505 lyric words, 433,936 songs, and 44,696 artists into the same shared vector space and found that the system can appropriately calculate similarities between different aspects and blend flavors to find related lyric words, songs, and artists.",

Hierarchical structure annotation expands this idea to allow an annotator to segment a song with multiple levels of granularity. While there has been recent progress in developing evaluation criteria for comparing two hierarchical annotations of the same recording, the existing methods have known deficiencies when dealing with inexact label matchings and sequential label repetition. In this article, we investigate methods for automatically enhancing structural annotations by inferring (and expanding) hierarchical information from the segment labels. The proposed method complements existing techniques for comparing hierarchical structural annotations by coarsening or refining labels with variation markers to either collapse similarly labeled segments together, or separate identically labeled segments from each other. Using the multi-level structure annotations provided in the SALAMI dataset, we demonstrate that automatic hierarchy expansion allows structure comparison methods to more accurately assess similarity between annotations.",

Training them for various tasks at once commonly results in worse performances than training them for a single specialized task. In this work, we introduce the Conditioned-U-Net (C-U-Net) which adds a control mechanism to the standard U-Net. The control mechanism allows us to train a unique and generic U-Net to perform the separation of various instruments. The C-U-Net decides the instrument to isolate according to a one-hot-encoding input vector. The input vector is embedded to obtain the parameters that control Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers. FiLM layers modify the U-Net feature maps in order to separate the desired instrument via affine transformations. The C-U-Net performs different instrument separations, all with a single model achieving the same performances as the dedicated ones at a lower cost.",

To examine and automate the task of musical schemata classification, we developed a novel musical schemata classifier. First, we tested methods for exact and approximate matching of user-defined schemata prototypes, to establish the notions of identity and similarity between composite music patterns. Next, we examined methods for schemata prototype extraction from collections of same-labelled annotated examples, performing training and testing sessions similar to supervised learning approaches. The performance of the above tasks was verified using the same annotated dataset of 40 keyboard sonata excerpts from pre-Classical and Classical periods. Our evaluation of the classifier sheds light on: (a)~ability to parse and interpret music information, (b)~similarity methods for composite music patterns, (c)~categorization methods for polyphonic music.",

We then examine the temporal evolution of complexity, reporting consistent changes across decades, such as a decrease in average loudness complexity since the 1960s, and an increase in timbre complexity overall but not for popular songs. We also show, in contrast to claims that popular songs sound more alike over time, that they are not more similar than they were 50 years ago in terms of pitch or rhythm, although similarity in timbre shows distinctive patterns across eras and similarity in loudness has been increasing.

    "description": "Target-based assisted orchestration can be thought of as the process of searching for optimal combinations of sounds to match a target sound, given a database of samples, a similarity metric, and a set of constraints. A typical solution to this problem is a proposed orchestral score where candidate scores are ranked by similarity in some feature space between the target sound and the mixture of audio samples in the database corresponding to the notes in the score; in the orchestral setting, valid scores may contain dozens of instruments sounding simultaneously. Generally, target-based assisted orchestration systems consist of a combinatorial optimization algorithm and a constraint solver that are jointly optimized to find valid solutions. A key step in the optimization involves generating a large number of combinations of sounds from the database and then comparing the features of each mixture of sounds with the target sound. Because of the high computational cost required to synthesize a new audio file and then compute features for every combination of sounds, in practice, existing systems instead estimate the features of each new mixture using precomputed features of the individual source files making up the combination. Currently, state of the art systems use a simple linear combination to make these predictions, even if the features in use are not themselves linear. In this work, we explore neural models for estimating the features of a mixture of sounds from the features of the component sounds, finding that standard features can be estimated with accuracy significantly better than that of the methods currently used in assisted orchestration systems. We present quantitative comparisons and discuss the implications of our findings for target-based orchestration problems.",

    "description": "A common method to create beat annotations for music recordings is to let a human annotator tap along with them. However, this method is problematic due to the limited human ability to temporally align taps with audio cues for beats accurately. In order to create accurate beat annotations, it is therefore typically necessary to manually correct the recorded taps in a subsequent step, which is a cumbersome task. In this work we aim to automate this correction step by \"snapping\" the taps to close-by audio cues - a strategy that is often used by beat tracking algorithms to refine their beat estimates. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, we formalize the automated correction procedure mathematically. Second, we introduce a novel visualization method that serves as a tool to analyze the results of the correction procedure for potential errors. Third, we present a new dataset consisting of beat annotations for 101 music recordings. Fourth, we use this dataset to perform a listening experiment as well as a quantitative study to show the effectiveness of our snapping procedure.",

In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an additional soft-attention mechanism on the audio input. Quantitative and qualitative results on synthesized piano data indicate that this attention increases the robustness of the retrieval system by focusing on different parts of the input representation based on the tempo of the audio.

In this paper we aim to contribute to Chaachoo's theory by means of tf-idf analysis. A highorder n-gram model is applied to a corpus of 149 prescriptive transcriptions of heterophonic recordings, representing each as an unordered multiset of patterns. Computing the tf-idf statistic of each pattern in this corpus provides a means by which we can rank and compare motivic content across nawab\u0101t, distinct musical forms of the tradition. For each nawba, an empirical comparison is made between patterns identified as significant via our approach and those proposed by Chaachoo. Ultimately we observe considerable agreement between the two pattern sets and go further in proposing new, unique and as yet undocumented patterns that occur at least as frequently and with at least as much importance as those in Chaachoo's proposals.",

We compare this to predicting emotion directly with an identical network that does not take into account the mid-level features, and observe that the cost of going through the mid-level features is surprisingly low, on average. The design of our network allows us to visualize the effects of perceptual features on individual emotion predictions, and we argue that the small loss in performance in going through the mid-level features is justified by the gain in explainability of the predictions.",

In this paper, we propose the Harmony Transformer, a multi-task music harmony analysis model aiming to improve chord recognition through incorporating chord segmentation into the recognition process.

The timbral features in each section are assumed to follow emission distributions that are homogeneous over time.

The adaptivity introduces invariance of the local intonation measure to global intonation drifts. In our experiments, we compute this measure for several recordings of Anton Bruckner's choir piece Locus Iste. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed measure by comparing scenarios of different complexity regarding the availability of aligned scores and multi-track recordings, as well as the number of singers per part.

Previous approaches to automatic tablature transcription break the problem into two steps: 1) polyphonic pitch estimation, followed by 2) tablature fingering arrangement. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we can jointly solve both steps by learning a mapping directly from audio data to tablature. The model can simultaneously leverage physical playability constraints and differences in string timbres implicit in the data to determine the actual fingerings being used by the guitarist. We propose TabCNN, a CNN for estimating guitar tablature from audio of a solo acoustic guitar performance. We train and test our network using microphone recordings from the GuitarSet dataset, and TabCNN outperforms a state-of-the-art multipitch estimation algorithm. We also introduce a set of metrics to evaluate guitar tablature estimation.",

    "description": "Previous approaches in singer identification have used one of monophonic vocal tracks or mixed tracks containing multiple instruments, leaving a semantic gap between these two domains of audio. In this paper, we present a system to learn a joint embedding space of monophonic and mixed tracks for singing voice. We use a metric learning method, which ensures that tracks from both domains of the same singer are mapped closer to each other than those of different singers. We train the system on a large synthetic dataset generated by music mashup to reflect real-world music recordings. Our approach opens up new possibilities for cross-domain tasks, e.g., given a monophonic track of a singer as a query, retrieving mixed tracks sung by the same singer from the database. Also, it requires no additional vocal enhancement steps such as source separation. We show the effectiveness of our system for singer identification and singer-based music retrieval in both the in-domain and cross-domain tasks.",

However, most interactions with music in current consumer voice devices are still relatively transactional; primarily allowing for keyword-based commands and basic content playback controls. They are less likely to contextualize content or support content discovery beyond what users think to ask for.

We propose an efficient new conditional probabilistic factorization of musical scores, viewing a score as a collection of concurrent, coupled sequences: i.e. voices.

    "description": "Assessing the potential success of a given song based on its acoustic characteristics is an important task in the music industry. This task has mostly been approached from an internal perspective, utilizing audio descriptors to predict the success of a given song, where either low- or high-level audio features have been utilized separately. In this work, we aim to jointly exploit low- and high-level audio features and model the prediction as a regression task. Particularly, we make use of a wide and deep neural network architecture that allows for jointly exploiting low- and high-level features. Furthermore, we enrich the set of features with information about the release year of tracks. We evaluate our approach based on the Million Song Dataset and characterize a song as a hit if it is contained in the Billboard Hot 100 at any point in time. Our findings suggest that the proposed approach is able to outperform baseline approaches as well as approaches utilizing low- or high-level features individually. Furthermore, we find that incorporating the release year as well as features describing mood and vocals of a song improve prediction results.",

Although the task itself is interesting and challenging for both academia and industry scenarios, there are a number of limitations for the advancement of current approaches. We specifically address two of them in the present study. First, the number of publicly available datasets for this task is limited, and there is no publicly available benchmark set that is widely used among researchers for comparative algorithm evaluation. Second, most of the algorithms are not publicly shared and reproducible, limiting the comparison of approaches. To overcome these limitations we propose Da-TACOS, a DaTAset for COver Song Identification and Understanding, and two frameworks for feature extraction and benchmarking to facilitate reproducibility. Da-TACOS contains 25K songs represented by unique editorial metadata plus 9 low- and mid-level features pre-computed with open source libraries, and is divided into two subsets. The Cover Analysis subset contains audio features (e.g. key, tempo) that can serve to study how musical characteristics vary for cover songs. The Benchmark subset contains the set of features that have been frequently used in CSI research, e.g. chroma, MFCC, beat onsets etc. Moreover, we provide initial benchmarking results of a selected number of state-of-the-art CSI algorithms using our dataset, and for reproducibility, we share a GitHub repository containing the feature extraction and benchmarking frameworks.",

    "description": "Music is hierarchically structured, both in how it is perceived by listeners and how it is composed. Such structure can be captured elegantly using probabilistic grammatical models similar to those used to study natural language. They address the complexity of the structure using abstract categories in a recursive formalism. Most existing grammatical models of musical structure focus on one single dimension of music--such as melody, harmony, or rhythm. While these grammar models often work well on short musical excerpts, accurate analysis of longer pieces requires taking into account the constraints from multiple domains of structure. The present paper proposes abstract product grammars--a formalism which integrates multiple dimensions of musical structure into a single grammatical model--along with efficient parsing and inference algorithms for this formalism. We use this model to study the combination of hierarchically-structured harmonic syntax and hierarchically-structured rhythmic information. The latter is modeled by a novel grammar of rhythm that is capable of expressing temporal regularities in musical phrases. It integrates grouping structure and meter. The combined model of harmony and rhythm outperforms both single-dimension models in computational experiments. All models are trained and evaluated on a treebank of hand-annotated Jazz standards.",

To this end, a novel deep learning-based approach for musical score inpainting is proposed. The designed model takes both past and future musical context into account and is capable of suggesting ways to connect them in a musically meaningful manner. To achieve this, we leverage the representational power of the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder and train a Recurrent Neural Network which learns to traverse this latent space conditioned on the past and future musical contexts. Consequently, the designed model is capable of generating several measures of music to connect two musical excerpts. The capabilities and performance of the model are showcased by comparison with competitive baselines using several objective and subjective evaluation methods. The results show that the model generates meaningful inpaintings and can be used in interactive music creation applications. Overall, the method demonstrates the merit of learning complex trajectories in the latent spaces of deep generative models.",

    "description": "While Georgia has a long history of orally transmitted polyphonic singing, there is still an ongoing controversial discussion among ethnomusicologists on the tuning system underlying this type of music. First attempts have been made to analyze tonal properties (e. g., harmonic and melodic intervals) based on fundamental frequency (F0) trajectories. One major challenge in F0-based tonal analysis is introduced by unstable regions in the trajectories due to pitch slides and other frequency fluctuations. In this paper, we describe two approaches for detecting stable regions in frequency trajectories: the first algorithm uses morphological operations inspired by image processing, and the second one is based on suitably defined binary time\u2013frequency masks. To avoid undesired distortions in subsequent analysis steps, both approaches keep the original F0-values unmodified, while only removing F0-values in unstable trajectory regions. We evaluate both approaches against manually annotated stable regions and discuss their potential in the context of interval analysis for traditional three-part Georgian singing.",

However, no matter how highly recognized a song might be at the beginning of its life, its recognition will inevitably and progressively decay. The mechanism that governs this decreasing trajectory could be modelled as a forgetting curve or a collective memory decay process. Here, we propose a composite model, termed T-REC, that involves chart data, YouTube views, Spotify popularity of tracks and forgetting curve dynamics with the purpose of estimating song recognition levels. We also present a comparative study, involving state-of-the-art and baseline models based on ground truth data from a survey that we conducted regarding the recognition level of 100 songs in Sweden. Our method is found to perform best among this ensemble of models. A remarkable finding of our study pertains to the role of the number of weeks a song remains in the charts, which is found to be a major factor for the accurate estimation of the song recognition level.",

Invertible models unify both discriminative and generative aspects in one function, sharing one set of parameters. Introducing invertibility enables the practitioner to directly inspect what the discriminative model has learned, and exactly determine which inputs lead to which outputs. For the task of transcribing polyphonic audio into symbolic form, these models may be especially useful as they allow us to observe, for instance, to what extent the concept of single notes could be learned from a corpus of polyphonic music alone (which has been identified as a serious problem in recent research). This is an entirely new approach to audio transcription, which first of all necessitates some groundwork. In this paper, we begin by looking at the simplest possible invertible transcription model, and then thoroughly investigate its properties. Finally, we will take first steps towards a more sophisticated and capable version. We use the task of piano transcription, and specifically the MAPS dataset, as a basis for these investigations.",

One of these problems, known as the \\textit{all-partition array problem}, is a particularly hard variant of set covering, and several different approaches, including mathematical optimization, constraint satisfaction, and greedy backtracking, have been proposed for solving it. Of these previous approaches, only constraint programming has led to a successful solution. Unfortunately, this solution is expensive in terms of computation time. We present here two new search heuristics and a modification to a previously proposed heuristic, that, when applied to a greedy backtracking algorithm, allow the all-partition array problem to be solved in a practical running time. We demonstrate the success of our heuristics by solving for three different instances of the problem found in Babbitt's music, including one previously solved with constraint programming and one Babbitt himself was unable to solve. Use of the new heuristics allows each instance of the problem to be solved more quickly than was possible with previous approaches.",

These features concern rhythmic, harmonic and textural aspects of the music and characterize either the MC, its preparation or the texture contrast between TR and S. They are used to train a LSTM neural network on a corpus of 27 movements of string quartets written by Mozart. The model correctly locates the MCs on 14 movements within a leave-one-piece-out validation strategy. We discuss these results and how the network manages to model such structural breaks.",

The network is trained and validated on empirical data gathered from an experiment in which sound engineers choose their preferred attenuation factors for a set of tracks.

The cross-scape plot is computed by stacking up a minimum local distance between two segments from each of the two songs. As the layer goes up, the segment size increases and it computes incrementally more long-term distances. This hierarchical representation allows for capturing the location and length of similar segments between two songs in a visually intuitive manner. We show the effectiveness of the cross-scape plot by evaluating it on examples from folk music collections with similarity-based categories and plagiarism cases.",

We use scheduled sampling to make the MLM robust to noisy sequences during testing. We analyze the performance of our model on the MAPS dataset using two different timesteps (40ms and 16th-note), comparing it against a strong baseline hidden Markov model with a training method not used before for the task to our knowledge.

    "description": "Hierarchical models of music allow explanation of highly complex musical structure based on the general principle of recursive elaboration and a small set of orthogonal operations. Recent approaches to melodic elaboration have converged to a representation based on intervals, which allows the elaboration of pairs of notes. However, two problems remain: First, an interval-first representation obscures one-sided operations like neighbor notes. Second, while models of Western melody styles largely agree on step-wise operations such as neighbors and passing notes, larger intervals are either attributed to latent harmonic properties or left unexplained. This paper presents a grammar for melodies in North Indian raga music, showing not only that recursively applied neighbor and passing note operations underlie this style as well, but that larger intervals are generated as generalized neighbors, based on the tonal hierarchy of the underlying scale structure. The notion of a generalized neighbor is not restricted to ragas but can be transferred to other musical styles, opening new perspectives on latent structure behind melodies and music in general. The presented grammar is based on a graph representation that allows one to express elaborations on both notes and intervals, unifying and generalizing previous graph- and tree-based approaches.",

First, the similarity scores are not necessarily metrics and are not directly comparable. Second, the algorithms are mostly first-order and of quadratic time-complexity, and finally, the features and weights need to be defined precisely. We propose an alternative approach which employs deep neural networks for end-to-end similarity metric learning. We contrast and compare different recurrent neural architectures (LSTM and GRU) for representing symbolic melodies as continuous vectors, and demonstrate how duplet and triplet loss functions can be employed to learn compact distributional representations of symbolic music in an induced melody space. This approach is contrasted with an alignment-based approach.

    "description": "This work aims to characterize microtiming variations in traditional Shetland fiddle music. These microtiming variations dictate the rhythmic flow of a performed melody, and contribute, among other things, to the suitability of this music as an accompaniment to dancing. In the context of Shetland fiddle music, these microtiming variations are often referred to as lilt. Using a corpus of 27 traditional fiddle tunes from the Shetland Isles, we examine inter-beat timing deviations, as well as inter-onset timing deviations of eighth note sequences. Results show a number of distinct inter-beat and inter-onset rhythmic patterns that may characterize lilt, as well as idiosyncratic patterns for each performer. This paper presents a first step towards the use of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques for modelling lilt in traditional Scottish fiddle music, and highlights its implications in the field of ethnomusicology.",

The process includes scanning paper rolls, digitizing the hole punches, and translating the pneumatic expression codings into MIDI format to create expressive performance files. We offer derivative files from each step of this process, including a high resolution image of the roll, a \"raw\" MIDI file of hole data, an \"expressive\" MIDI file that translates hole data into dynamics, and an audio file rendering of the expressive MIDI file on a digital piano sample. This provides digital access to the rolls for researchers in a flexible, searchable online database. We currently offer an initial dataset, \"SUPRA-RW\" from a selection of \"red Welte\"-type rolls in the SUPRA.

High-quality speech synthesis utilizes detailed linguistic features for conditioning, but comparable levels of control have yet to be realized for neural synthesis of musical instruments.

We find the appropriate choice of conditioning features and architectures improves both the quantitative accuracy of audio resynthesis and qualitative responsiveness to creative manipulation of conditioning.

Raga Recognition is an important music information retrieval task in ICM as it can aid numerous downstream applications ranging from music recommendations to organizing huge music collections. In this work, we propose a deep learning based approach to Raga recognition. Our approach employs efficient pre-possessing and learns temporal sequences in music data using Long Short Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN). We train and test the network on smaller sequences sampled from the original audio while the final inference is performed on the audio as a whole. Our method achieves an accuracy of 88.1% and 97 % during inference on theComp Music Carnatic dataset and its 10 Raga subset respectively making it the state-of-the-art for the Raga recognition task. Our approach also enables sequence ranking which aids us in retrieving melodic patterns from a given music database that are closely related to the presented query sequence.",

The pitch activation input is structured to allow the first CNN layer to compute two pitch chromas focused on different octaves. The following layers perform harmony analysis across chroma and time scales. Through max pooling across pitch, the CNN becomes invariant with regards to the key class (i.e., key disregarding mode) of the music. A multilayer perceptron combines the modality activation output with spectral features for the final prediction. The study uses a dataset of 203 excerpts rated by around 20 listeners each, a small challenging data size requiring a carefully designed parameter sharing. With an R2 of about 0.71, the system clearly outperforms previous systems as well as individual human listeners. A final ablation study highlights the importance of using pitch activations processed across longer time scales, and using pooling to facilitate invariance with regards to the key class.",

More recently, several attempts have been made to extend such approaches to music (both symbolic and audio) in order to enable transforming musical style in a similar manner. In this study, we focus on symbolic music with the goal of altering the 'style' of a piece while keeping its original 'content'. As opposed to the current methods, which are inherently restricted to be unsupervised due to the lack of 'aligned' data (i.e. the same musical piece played in multiple styles), we develop the first fully supervised algorithm for this task. At the core of our approach lies a synthetic data generation scheme which allows us to produce virtually unlimited amounts of aligned data, and hence avoid the above issue. In view of this data generation scheme, we propose an encoder-decoder model for translating symbolic music accompaniments between a number of different styles. Our experiments show that our models, although trained entirely on synthetic data, are capable of producing musically meaningful accompaniments even for real (non-synthetic) MIDI recordings.",

    "description": "Analogy-making is a key method for computer algorithms to generate both natural and creative music pieces. In general, an analogy is made by partially transferring the music abstractions, i.e., high-level representations and their relationships, from one piece to another; however, this procedure requires disentangling music representations, which usually takes little effort for musicians but is non-trivial for computers. Three sub-problems arise: extracting latent representations from the observation, disentangling the representations so that each part has a unique semantic interpretation, and mapping the latent representations back to actual music. In this paper, we contribute an explicitly-constrained variational autoencoder (EC^2-VAE) as a unified solution to all three sub-problems. We focus on disentangling the pitch and rhythm representations of 8-beat music clips conditioned on chords. In producing music analogies, this model helps us to realize the imaginary situation of \"what if\" a piece is composed using a different pitch contour, rhythm pattern, or chord progression by borrowing the representations from other pieces. Finally, we validate the proposed disentanglement method using objective measurements and evaluate the analogy examples by a subjective study.",

To retrieve music for an input video, the trained model ranks tracks in the music database by cross-modal distances to the query video. Quantitative evaluations show high accuracy of audio/video emotion tagging when evaluated on each branch independently and high performance for cross-modal music retrieval. We also present cross-modal music retrieval experiments on Spotify music using user-generated videos from Instagram and Youtube as queries, and subjective evaluations show that the proposed model can retrieve relevant music.

This problem hinders the practical usages of audio recognition systems. The difficulty mainly lies in the intrinsic long-tail distribution of chord qualities, and most chord qualities have too few samples for model training. In this paper, we propose a new model for audio chord recognition under a huge chord vocabulary. The core concept is to decompose any chord label into a set of musically meaningful components (e.g., triad, bass, seventh), each with a much smaller vocabulary compared to the size of the overall chord vocabulary. A multitask classifier is then trained to recognize all the components given the audio feature, and then labels of individual components are reassembled to form the final chord label. Experiments show that the proposed system not only achieves state-of-the-art results on traditional evaluation metrics but also performs well on a large vocabulary.",

To improve the quality and structure of the generated music, we integrated music theory knowledge into the model, such as controlling the spacing of gaps in the vocal melody, normalizing the timing of chord changes, and requiring notes to be related to the song's key (C major, for example). This integration improved the quality of the generated music as verified by a professional composer.

These approaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various time-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the cross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes conditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot accurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the time-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the ground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement in both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a state-of-the-art music transcription model. Our results show that adversarial learning can significantly reduce the error rate while increasing the confidence of the model estimations. Our approach is generic and applicable to any transcription model based on multi-label predictions, which are very common in music signal analysis.",

HumdrumR leverages R's powerful metaprogramming capabilities to create an extremely expressive and composable syntax, allowing novices to achieve usable analyses quickly while avoiding many coding concepts that are commonly challenging for beginners.",

    "description": "Music is well established as a means of social connection. In the age of streaming platforms, personalized playlists and recommendations are popular topics in music information retrieval. We bring the focus of music enjoyment back to social connection and examine how technologies can enhance interpersonal relationships, specifically through the context of the collaborative playlist (CP). We conducted an exploratory study of CP users and non-users (N=65) and examined speculative and experienced purposes and outcomes of CPs, as well as general perspectives on music and social connectedness. We derived a CP Framework with three purposes - Practical, Cognitive, and Social - and two connotations - Utility and Orientation. Both users and non-users shared similar perspectives on music-related activities and CP user outcomes. Projected and actual CP purposes differed between groups, however, as did perception of music's role in connectedness in recent years. These results highlight the importance of music-based social interactions for both groups.",

    "description": "We present a framework based on neural networks to extract music scores directly from polyphonic audio in an end-to-end fashion. Most previous Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) methods seek a piano-roll representation of the pitches, that can be further transformed into a score by incorporating tempo estimation, beat tracking, key estimation or rhythm quantization. Unlike these methods, our approach generates music notation directly from the input audio in a single stage. For this, we use a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function which does not require annotated alignments of audio frames with the score rhythmic information. We trained our model using as input Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven string quartets and Bach chorales synthesized with different tempos and expressive performances. The output is a textual representation of four-voice music scores based on **kern format. Although the proposed approach is evaluated in a simplified scenario, results show that this model can learn to transcribe scores directly from audio signals, opening a promising avenue towards complete AMT.",

    "description": "Single-f0 estimation methods, including pitch trackers and melody estimators, have historically been evaluated using a set of common metrics which score estimates frame-wise in terms of pitch and voicing accuracy. \"Voicing\" refers to whether or not a pitch is active, and has historically been regarded as a binary value. However, this has limitations because it is often ambiguous whether a pitch is present or absent, making a binary choice difficult for humans and algorithms alike. For example, when a source fades out or reverberates, the exact point where the pitch is no longer present is unclear. Many single-f0 estimation algorithms select a threshold for when a pitch is active or not, and different choices of threshold drastically affect the results of standard metrics. In this paper, we present a refinement on the existing single-f0 metrics, by allowing the estimated voicing to be represented as a continuous likelihood, and introducing a weighting on frame level pitch accuracy, which considers the energy of the source producing the f0 relative to the energy of the rest of the signal. We compare these metrics experimentally with the previous metrics using a number of algorithms and datasets and discuss the fundamental differences. We show that, compared to the previous metrics, our proposed metrics allow threshold-independent algorithm comparisons.",

We adapt a framework based on variational autoencoders with Gaussian mixture latent distributions. Specifically, we use two separate encoders to learn distinct latent spaces for timbre and pitch, which form Gaussian mixture components representing instrument identity and pitch, respectively. For reconstruction, latent variables of timbre and pitch are sampled from corresponding mixture components, and are concatenated as the input to a decoder. We show the model's efficacy using latent space visualization, and a quantitative analysis indicates the discriminability of these spaces, even with a limited number of instrument labels for training. The model allows for controllable synthesis of selected instrument sounds by sampling from the latent spaces. To evaluate this, we trained instrument and pitch classifiers using original labeled data. These classifiers achieve high F-scores when tested on our synthesized sounds, which verifies the model's performance of controllable realistic timbre/pitch synthesis. Our model also enables timbre transfer between multiple instruments, with a single encoder-decoder architecture, which is evaluated by measuring the shift in the posterior of instrument classification. Our in-depth evaluation confirms the model's ability to successfully disentangle timbre and pitch.",

After 20 years of annual conferences and workshops, this number has grown to an impressive amount of almost 2,000 papers. When restricted to linear search and retrieval in a document collection of this size, it becomes inherently hard to identify topics, related work and trends in scientific research. Therefore, this paper presents and evaluates a map-based user interface for exploring 20 years of ISMIR publications. The interface visualizes k-nearest neighbor subsets of semantically similar papers. Users may jump from one neighborhood to the next by selecting another paper from the current subset. Through animated transitions between local k-nn maps, the interface creates the impression of panning a large global map. Evaluations results of a small user study suggest that users are able to discover interesting links between papers. Due to its generic approach, the interface is easily applicable to other document collections as well. The search interface and its source code will be made publicly available.",

    "description": "Musical pattern discovery algorithms find instances of repetition in symbolic music, allowing for some user-specifiable amount of variation between identified repetitions; however, they can yield an intractably large number of discovered patterns when allowing for even small amounts of variation. This is commonly addressed by defining some heuristic notion of pattern significance, and returning only the most significant patterns. This paper develops a method of pattern discovery that models human judgement of what constitutes a significant pattern by incorporating annotations of repeated patterns, avoiding the need to design heuristics. We take pattern discovery as a clustering task, where the input is a set of passages of monophonic music, represented as vectors of extracted features, and the output clusters correspond to discovered patterns. The human annotations are used to train a neural network to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the feature space that maps passages of music close together when they are occurrences of the same ground-truth pattern. The results of this approach match up with the annotations significantly better than the results of an approach using clustering without subspace learning. We provide examples of the types of patterns that this method tends to discover and discuss its feasibility and practicality as a tool for extracting useful information about repetitive structure in music.",

    "description": "Quantitative analysis of commonalities and differences between recorded music performances is an increasingly common task in computational musicology. A typical scenario involves manual annotation of different recordings of the same piece along the time dimension, for comparative analysis of, e.g., the musical tempo, or for mapping other performance-related information between performances. This can be done by manually annotating one reference performance, and then automatically synchronizing other performances, using audio-to-audio alignment algorithms. In this paper we address several questions related to those tasks. First, we analyze different annotations of the same musical piece, quantifying timing deviations between the respective human annotators. A statistical evaluation of the marker time stamps will provide (a) an estimate of the expected timing precision of human annotations and (b) a ground truth for subsequent automatic alignment experiments. We then carry out a systematic evaluation of different audio features for audio-to-audio alignment, quantifying the degree of alignment accuracy that can be achieved, and relate this to the results from the annotation study.",

We conducted an experiment in which we asked twenty-two professional drummers to perform a simple rhythmic pattern while listening to a metronome. Here, we investigate the strategies they employed to express three different instructed timing profiles for the same pattern: \"on\", \"pushed\" and \"laidback\". Our analysis of the recordings follows three stages. First, we compute sixteen binary features that capture the micro-timing relations of the kick, snare and hi-hat drum on-sets, between each other and with regards to the metrical grid. Second, we construct a micro-timing profile (mtP) for every performance by averaging the binary features across the recording. An mtP codifies the frequency with which the various features were found in a performance. Third, through a \"similarity profiles\" hierarchical clustering analysis, we identify groups of recordings with significant similarities in their mtPs. We found distinct strategies to express each intended timing profile that employ specific combinations of relations between the instruments and with regards to the meter. Finally, we created a map that summarizes the main characteristics of the strategies and their relations using a phylogenetic tree visualization.",

    "description": "This paper proposes an improved singing aid system for laryngectomees that converts electrolaryngeal (EL) speech produced using an electrolarynx to a more naturally sounding singing voice. Although the previously proposed system employing a noise suppression process and a rule-based pitch control approach has achieved preliminary success in converting EL speech into a singing voice, there are still two major limitations. First, the converted singing voice still sounds mechanical and unnatural owing to the adverse impacts of spectrograms extracted from EL speeches, also making the effect of pitch control limited. Second, the capability and flexibility of the rule-based pitch control in modeling various singing styles are insufficient, causing the converted singing voices to lack variety. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an improved system that uses 1) a statistical voice conversion approach to convert spectrograms extracted from EL speeches into those of natural speeches and 2) a deep generative model-based approach called VAE-SPACE for pitch modification, which generates pitch patterns in a data-driven manner instead of following manually designed rules. The experimental results revealed that 1) the conversion of spectrograms was effective in improving the naturalness of singing voices, and 2) the statistical pitch control approach was able to achieve comparable results with the rule-based approach, which was very carefully designed to be specialized in singing.",

A common feature of these techniques is the periodic modulation in the time--frequency domain. We propose a representation based on time--frequency scattering to model the inter-class variability for fine discrimination of these periodic modulations. Time--frequency scattering is an instance of the scattering transform, an approach for building invariant, stable, and informative signal representations. The proposed representation is calculated around the wavelet subband of maximal acoustic energy, rather than over all the wavelet bands. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we build a system that computes the representation as input to a machine learning classifier. Whereas previously published datasets for playing technique analysis focus primarily on techniques recorded in isolation, for ecological validity, we create a new dataset to evaluate the system. The dataset, named CBF-periDB, contains full-length expert performances on the Chinese bamboo flute that have been thoroughly annotated by the players themselves. We report F-measures of 99% for flutter-tongue, 82% for trill, 69% for vibrato, and 51% for tremolo detection, and provide explanatory visualisations of scattering coefficients for each of these techniques.",

Here, we choose a new angle for the genre study by seeking to predict what would be the genres of musical items in a target tag system, knowing the genres assigned to them within source tag systems. We call this a translation task and identify three cases: 1) no common annotated corpus between source and target tag systems exists, 2) such a large corpus exists, 3) only few common annotations exist. We propose the related solutions: a knowledge-based translation modeled as taxonomy mapping, a statistical translation modeled with maximum likelihood logistic regression; a hybrid translation modeled with maximum a posteriori logistic regression with priors given by the knowledge-based translation. During evaluation, the solutions fit well the identified cases and the hybrid translation is systematically the most effective w.r.t. multilabel classification metrics.

We present an interactive workflow to address these problems, and test it on Bach chorales. First, a rule-based model was used to generate preliminary, consistent chord labels in order to pre-train three machine learning models. These four models were grouped into an ensemble that generated chord labels by voting, achieving 91.4% accuracy on a reserved test set. A domain expert then corrected only those chords that the ensemble did not agree on unanimously (20.9% of the generated labels). Finally, we used these corrected annotations to re-train the machine learning models, and the resulting ensemble attained an accuracy of 93.5% on the reserved test set, a 24.4% reduction in the number of errors. This versatile interactive workflow can either work in a fully automatic way, or can capitalize on relatively minimal human involvement to generate higher-quality chord labels. It combines the consistency of rule-based models with the nuance of manual analysis to generate relatively inexpensive high-quality ground truth for training effective machine learning models.",

Experimental evidence demonstrates that StyleRank is highly correlated with human perception of stylistic similarity, and that it is precise enough to rank generated samples based on their similarity to the style of a corpus.

Improvements in deep learning lead to a big progress in music source separation performance.

In this study, we propose a network for audio query-based music source separation that can explicitly encode the source information from a query signal regardless of the number and/or kind of target signals. The proposed method consists of a Query-net and a Separator: given a query and a mixture, the Query-net encodes the query into the latent space, and the Separator estimates masks conditioned by the latent vector, which is then applied to the mixture for separation. The Separator can also generate masks using the latent vector from the training samples, allowing separation in the absence of a query. We evaluate our method on the MUSDB18 dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method can separate multiple sources with a single network.

In this work, we investigate how to utilize local data representation with pattern recognition for onset and offset detection of singing voice. We consider onset and offset detection as a hierarchical classification problem, where every local data representation as input is classified into one of all the possible event states in monophonic singing, namely the silence, activation, and transition states, and the transition state is further classified into the onset and offset states. An objective function based on this hierarchical taxonomy nicely guides the model to capture the complicated temporal dynamics of note sequences. Multi-channel data representations containing spectral differences and pitch saliency are employed to reflect the patterns of note transition in singing voice signals. The proposed method implemented with residual networks provides improved performance over prior art in onset and offset detection. Moreover, by integrating with a pitch detection framework, the proposed method also outperforms previous singing voice transcription methods.

While audio-sheet music retrieval has been explored by a number of works, this scenario is novel in that the query is a cell phone picture rather than a digital scan. To solve this problem, we introduce a mid-level feature representation called a bootleg score which explicitly encodes the rules of Western musical notation. We convert both the MIDI and the sheet music into bootleg scores using deterministic rules of music and classical computer vision techniques for detecting simple geometric shapes. Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg scores, we estimate the alignment using dynamic programming. The most notable characteristic of our system is that it does test-time adaptation and has no trainable weights at all--only a set of about 30 hyperparameters. On a dataset containing 1000 cell phone pictures taken of 100 scores of classical piano music, our system achieves an F measure score of .869 and outperforms baseline systems based on commercial optical music recognition software.",

The backbone of the method consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) estimating the probability that each note in the score (more precisely: each pixel in a piano roll encoding of the score) belongs to the melody line. We train and evaluate the method on various datasets, using manual annotations where available and solo instrument parts where not. We also propose a method to inspect the CNN and to analyze the influence exerted by notes on the prediction of other notes; this method can be applied whenever the output of a neural network has the same size as the input.",

    "description": "This paper describes a statistical music structure analysis method that splits an audio signal of popular music into musically meaningful sections at the beat level and classifies them into predefined categories such as intro, verse, and chorus, where beat times are assumed to be estimated in advance. A basic approach to this task is to train a recurrent neural network (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) network) that directly predicts section labels from acoustic features. This approach, however, suffers from frequent musically unnatural label switching because the homogeneity, repetitiveness, and duration regularity of musical sections are hard to represent explicitly in the network architecture. To solve this problem, we formulate a unified hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents the generative process of homogeneous mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, repetitive chroma features, and mel spectra from section labels, where the emission probabilities of mel spectra are computed from the posterior probabilities of section labels predicted by an LSTM. Given these acoustic features, the most likely label sequence can be estimated with Viterbi decoding. The experimental results show that the proposed LSTM-HSMM hybrid model outperformed a conventional HSMM.",

    "description": "This paper describes a clustering-based music transcription method that estimates the piano rolls of arbitrary musical instrument parts from multi-instrument polyphonic music signals. If target musical pieces are always played by particular kinds of musical instruments, a way to obtain piano rolls is to compute the pitchgram (pitch saliency spectrogram) of each musical instrument by using a deep neural network (DNN). However, this approach has a critical limitation that it has no way to deal with musical pieces including undefined musical instruments. To overcome this limitation, we estimate a condensed pitchgram with an existing instrument-independent neural multi-pitch estimator and then separate the pitchgram into a specified number of musical instrument parts with a deep spherical clustering technique. To improve the performance of transcription, we propose a joint spectrogram and pitchgram clustering method based on the timbral and pitch characteristics of musical instruments. The experimental results show that the proposed method can transcribe musical pieces including unknown musical instruments as well as those containing only predefined instruments, at the state-of-the-art transcription accuracy.",

    "description": "This paper explores sequential modelling of polyphonic music with deep neural networks. While recent breakthroughs have focussed on network architecture, we demonstrate that the representation of the sequence can make an equally significant contribution to the performance of the model as measured by validation set loss. By extracting salient features inherent to the training dataset, the model can either be conditioned on these features or trained to predict said features as extra components of the sequences being modelled. We show that training a neural network to predict a seemingly more complex sequence, with extra features included in the series being modelled, can improve overall model performance significantly. We first introduce TonicNet, a GRU-based model trained to initially predict the chord at a given time-step before then predicting the notes of each voice at that time-step, in contrast with the typical approach of predicting only the notes. We then evaluate TonicNet on the canonical JSB Chorales dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results.",

    "description": "Studies have shown that repeated exposures to novel songs cause an increase in a person's memory and liking. These studies are commonly verified through self-reporting emotion-based surveys. This paper proposes the \"retention rate\" as an additional parameter for evaluation. The \"retention rate\" is one at which the listener revisits the novel items. The authors hypothesize that when a person listens to novel (i.e., both unfamiliar and interesting) pieces of music, the retention rate will be proportional to the number of times the discovery engine suggests the pieces to her, as long as they remain novel. The authors have tested the hypothesis through a six-week human-subject experiment that simulates a real-world listening environment and a follow-up survey. During the experiment period, each subject received, through Discover Weekly in Spotify, suggestions for novel songs up to three times and provided evaluation. One month after the evaluation experiment, the human-subjects answered whether they had revisited the novel songs. Through the analysis of the response and survey data, the researchers conclude that the more times a listener is exposed to a song during the discovery process, the more likely she is to return to the song.",

In this paper, we discuss how to model and measure local tempo in a musically meaningful way using a cross-version dataset of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's Mazurkas as a use case. In particular, we explore how tempo stability can be measured and taken into account during evaluation.

Furthermore, we show that different training\u2013test splits have a considerable impact on accuracy for difficult segments.",

    "description": "From the 19th century on, several composers of Western opera made use of leitmotifs (short musical ideas referring to semantic entities such as characters, places, items, or feelings) for guiding the audience through the plot and illustrating the events on stage. A prime example of this compositional technique is Richard Wagner's four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Across its different occurrences in the score, a leitmotif may undergo considerable musical variations. The concrete leitmotif instances in an audio recording are subject to acoustic variability. Our paper approaches the task of classifying such leitmotif instances in audio recordings. As our main contribution, we conduct a case study on a dataset covering 16 recorded performances of the Ring with annotations of ten central leitmotifs, leading to 2403 occurrences and 38448 instances in total. We build a neural network classification model and evaluate its ability to generalize across different performances and leitmotif occurrences. Our findings demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of leitmotif classification in audio recordings and pave the way towards the fully automated detection of leitmotifs in music recordings.",

We address this issue in two ways: (1) we recast the problem to be based on raw sheet music images rather than a symbolic music format, and (2) we propose an approach that can be trained on unlabeled data. Our approach first converts the sheet music image into a sequence of musical ``words\" based on the bootleg feature representation, and then feeds the sequence into a text classifier. We show that it is possible to significantly improve classifier performance by first training a language model on a set of unlabeled data, initializing the classifier with the pretrained language model weights, and then finetuning the classifier on a small amount of labeled data. We train AWD-LSTM, GPT-2, and RoBERTa language models on all piano sheet music images in IMSLP. We find that transformer-based architectures outperform CNN and LSTM models, and pretraining boosts classification accuracy for the GPT-2 model from 46% to 70% on a 9-way classification task. The trained model can also be used as a feature extractor that projects piano sheet music into a feature space that characterizes compositional style.",

    "description": "Many music information retrieval tasks involve the comparison of a symbolic score representation with an audio recording. A typical strategy is to compare score\u2013audio pairs based on a common mid-level representation, such as chroma features. Several recent studies demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models that learn task-specific mid-level representations from temporally aligned training pairs. However, in practice, there is often a lack of strongly aligned training data, in particular for real-world scenarios. In our study, we use weakly aligned score\u2013audio pairs for training, where only the beginning and end of a score excerpt is annotated in an audio recording, without aligned correspondences in between. To exploit such weakly aligned data, we employ the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to train a deep learning model for computing an enhanced chroma representation. We then apply this model to a cross-modal retrieval task, where we aim at finding relevant audio recordings of Western classical music, given a short monophonic musical theme in symbolic notation as a query. We present systematic experiments that show the effectiveness of the CTC-based model for this theme-based retrieval task.",

We used the Q methodology to explore which behaviors and influences are important to CMS users and why.

    "description": "Music copyright lawsuits often result in multimillion dollar damage awards or settlements, yet there are few objective guidelines for applying copyright law in in-fringement claims involving musical works. Recent re-search has attempted to develop objective methods based on automated similarity algorithms, but there remains almost no data on the role of perceived similarity in mu-sic copyright decisions despite its crucial role in copy-right law. We collected perceptual data from 20 partici-pants for 17 adjudicated copyright cases from the USA and Japan after editing the disputed sections to contain either full audio, melody only, or lyrics only. Due to the historical emphasis in legal opinions on melody as the key criterion for deciding infringement, we predicted that listening to melody-only versions would result in percep-tual judgements that more closely matched actual past legal decisions. Surprisingly, however, we found no sig-nificant differences between the three conditions, with participants matching past decisions in between 50-60% of cases in all three conditions. Automated algorithms designed to calculate melodic and audio similarity pro-duced comparable results: both algorithms were able to match past decisions with identical accuracy of 71% (12/17 cases). Analysis of cases that were difficult to classify suggests that melody, lyrics, and other factors sometimes interact in complex ways difficult to capture using quantitative metrics. We propose directions for fur-ther investigation of the role of similarity in music copy-right law using larger and more diverse samples of cases and enhanced methods, and adapting our perceptual ex-periment method to avoid relying for ground truth data only on court decisions (which may be subject to selec-tion bias). Our results contribute to important practical debates, such as whether jury members should be allowed to listen to full audio recordings during copyright cases.",

All of these studies have used the RAG-C dataset of approximately 11,000 symbolically-encoded ragtime pieces to identify salient rhythmic patterns in the corpus and qualify how they are used. Ragtime music is distinguished from other musical genres by frequent use of syncopation, and previous computational studies have confirmed a number of musicological hypotheses regarding the use of syncopated patterns in ragtime compositions. In this work, we extend these studies to investigate further questions involving the use of syncopation. Specifically, we introduce a new methodological framework for processing the RAG-C dataset and confirm that experiments from previous studies obtain similar results using the new methodology. We investigate the use of the common ``short-long-short'' syncopated pattern in different time periods and present new results detailing its use by three well-known ragtime composers. We describe how the use of other syncopated patterns has evolved over time and the different distributions of patterns that result from those changes.

The content of each individual file and the differences between them can then be described in relation to this shared structure. We first construct a large similarity graph of temporal segments, such as beats or bars, based on self-alignments and selected pair-wise alignments between the given input files. Part of this graph is then partitioned into groups of corresponding segments using multiple sequence alignment. This partitioned graph is searched for recurring sections which can be organized hierarchically based on their co-occurrence. We apply our approach to discover shared harmonic structure in a dataset containing a large number of different live performances of a number of songs. Our evaluation shows that using the joint information from a number of files has the advantage of evening out the noisiness or inaccuracy of the underlying feature data and leads to a robust estimate of shared musical material.",

Although chorus-section detection using audio signals has been studied, whether chorus sections can be detected from text-only lyrics is an open issue. Another open issue is whether patterns of repeating lyric lines such as those appearing in chorus sections depend on language. To investigate these issues, we propose a neural network-based model for sequence labeling. It can learn phrase repetition and linguistic features to detect chorus sections in lyrics text. It is, however, difficult to train this model since there was no dataset of lyrics with chorus-section annotations as there was no prior work on this task. We therefore generate a large amount of training data with such annotations by leveraging pairs of musical audio signals and their corresponding manually time-aligned lyrics; we first automatically detect chorus sections from the audio signals and then use their temporal positions to transfer them to the line-level chorus-section annotations for the lyrics. Experimental results show that the proposed model with the generated data contributes to detecting the chorus sections, that the model trained on Japanese lyrics can detect chorus sections surprisingly well in English lyrics and that patterns of repeating lyric lines are language-independent.",

With such limitations, an algorithm generating merely chord symbols is usually insufficient for a wide range of music genres such as jazz. To solve this problem, we propose chord jazzification, a process to generate realistic chord configurations in jazz style. With deep learning approaches, we decompose chord jazzification into coloring and voicing. Coloring concerns the choice of color tones, while voicing concerns the configurations of chords. We also create a new dataset featuring interpretations of chord symbols in pop-jazz compositions. By conducting experiments on the new dataset, we show that 1) the two-stage process outperforms an end-to-end generation approach in modeling chord configurations, and 2) attention-based models are better at capturing the structure of chord sequences in comparison with recurrent neural networks.",

    "description": "While deep generative models have become the leading methods for algorithmic composition, it remains a challenging problem to control the generation process because the latent variables of most deep-learning models lack good interpretability. Inspired by the content-style disentanglement idea, we design a novel architecture, under the VAE framework, that effectively learns two interpretable latent factors of polyphonic music: chord and texture. The current model focuses on learning 8-beat long piano composition segments. We show that such chord-texture disentanglement provides a controllable generation pathway leading to a wide spectrum of applications, including compositional style transfer, texture variation, and accompaniment arrangement. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that our method achieves a successful disentanglement and high quality controlled music generation.",

    "description": "We present Connective Fusion, a music generation scheme by transformational joining of two musical sequences for creative purposes. Given two shorter sequences as inputs, our model transforms each of them such that their concatenation is more coherent to form a longer sequence, while each of the transformed shorter sequences retains meaningful similarity with the corresponding input sequence. In short, our model connects and fuses two contextually unrelated sequences in a coherent way. This transformation can be applied iteratively to gradually fuse the input sequences. The style latent space is simultaneously learned, allowing users to control how the two sequences are merged. Our approach comprises two steps of unsupervised learning: a deep generative model with a latent space is learned, followed by adversarial learning of the transformation function in the latent space. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method through the task of melody creation using a symbolic music dataset.",

However, most, if not all, viable attempts on this problem have largely been limited to monophonic music. Normally composed of richer modality and more complex musical structures, the polyphonic counterpart has yet to be addressed in the context of music representation learning. In this work, we propose the PianoTree VAE, a novel tree-structure extension upon VAE aiming to fit the polyphonic music learning.

    "description": "As the field of Music Information Retrieval grows, it is important to take into consideration the multi-modality of music and how aspects of musical engagement such as movement and gesture might be taken into account. Bodily movement is universally associated with music and reflective of important individual features related to music preference such as personality, mood, and empathy. Future multimodal MIR systems may benefit from taking these aspects into account. The current study addresses this by identifying individual differences, specifically Big Five personality traits, and scores on the Empathy and Systemizing Quotients (EQ/SQ) from participants' free dance movements. Our model successfully explored the unseen space for personality as well as EQ, SQ, which has not previously been accomplished for the latter. R2 scores for personality, EQ, and SQ were 76.3%, 77.1%, and 86.7% respectively. As a follow-up, we investigated which bodily joints were most important in defining these traits. We discuss how further research may explore how the mapping of these traits to movement patterns can be used to build a more personalized, multi-modal recommendation system, as well as potential therapeutic applications.",

    "description": "Recent machine learning techniques have enabled a large variety of novel music generation processes. However, most approaches do not provide any form of interpretable control over musical attributes, such as pitch and rhythm. Obtaining control over the generation process is critically important for its use in real-life creative setups. Nevertheless, this problem remains arduous, as there are no known functions nor differentiable approximations to transform symbolic music with control of musical attributes.In this work, we propose a novel method that enables attributes-aware music transformation from any set of musical annotations, without requiring complicated derivative implementation. By relying on an adversarial confusion criterion on given musical annotations, we force the latent space of a generative model to abstract from these features. Then, reintroducing these features as conditioning to the generative function, we obtain a continuous control over them. To demonstrate our approach, we rely on sets of musical attributes computed by the jSymbolic library as annotations and conduct experiments that show that our method outperforms previous methods in control. Finally, comparing correlations between attributes and the transformed results show that our method can provide explicit control over any continuous or discrete annotation.",

The question of their ability to generalize to other languages, especially in low (or even zero) training resource scenarios has been so far left unexplored. In this paper, we address the lyrics-to-audio alignment task in a generalized multilingual setup. More precisely, this investigation presents the first (to the best of our knowledge) attempt to create a language-independent lyrics-to-audio alignment system. Building on a RNN model trained with a CTC algorithm, we study the relevance of different intermediate representations, either character or phoneme, along with several strategies to design a training set. The evaluation is conducted on multiple languages with a varying amount of data available, from plenty to zero. Results show that learning from diverse data and using a universal phoneme set as an intermediate representation yield the best generalization performances.",

Inspired by this, we re-frame the musical source separation problem as hierarchical, combining similar instruments together at certain levels and separating them at other levels. This allows us to deconstruct the same mixture in multiple ways, depending on the appropriate level of the hierarchy for a given application. In this paper, we present various methods for hierarchical musical instrument separation, with some methods focusing on separating specific instruments (like guitars) and other methods that determine what to separate based on a user-supplied audio example. We additionally show that separating all hierarchy levels is possible even when training data is limited at fine-grained levels of the hierarchy.",

This work concerns the automatic detection of the musically relevant rhythmic densities as they change in time across the bandish (composition) performance. An annotated dataset of Dhrupad bandish concert sections is presented. We implement a CNN-based system, trained to detect local tempo relationships, and follow it with temporal smoothing. We also employ audio source separation as a pre-processing step to the detection of the individual surface densities of the vocals and the percussion.

Maracatu percussive music is strongly repetitive, and is played as loud and as fast as possible. Both from an MIR and ethnomusicological perspective this makes a complex musical scene to analyse and interpret. In this paper we focus on the extraction of microtiming profiles towards the longer term goal of understanding how rhythmic performance in Maracatu is used to promote health and well-being. To conduct this analysis we use a set of recordings acquired with contact microphones which minimise the interference between performers. Our analysis reveals that the microtiming profiles differ substantially from those observed in more widely studied South American music. In particular, we highlight the presence of dynamic microtiming profiles as well as the importance of the choice of time-keeper instrument, which dictates how the performances can be understood. Throughout this work, we emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in which MIR, audio engineering, and ethnomusicology must interact to provide meaningful insight about this music.",

Recently, in order to explicitly consider this subjectivity, the annotation of music items was modeled as a translation task: predict for a music item its music genres within a target vocabulary or taxonomy (tag system) from a set of music genre tags originating from other tag systems. However, without a parallel corpus, previous solutions could not handle tag systems in other languages, being limited to the English-language only. Here, by learning multilingual music genre embeddings, we enable cross-lingual music genre translation without relying on a parallel corpus. First, we apply compositionality functions on pre-trained word embeddings to represent multi-word tags. Second, we adapt the tag representations to the music domain by leveraging multilingual music genres graphs with a modified retrofitting algorithm. Experiments show that our method: 1) is effective in translating music genres across tag systems in multiple languages (English, French and Spanish); 2) outperforms the previous baseline in an English-language multi-source translation task.",

    "description": "Musical form and syntax in Western classical music are hierarchically organised on different timescales. One of the most important features of this structure is the organisation of modulations between different keys throughout a piece. Music theoretical research has established taxonomies of prototypical modulation plans for different modes and musical forms. However, these prototypes still require empirical validation based on quantitative statistical methods and cannot be retrieved automatically so far.In this paper, we present a novel method to infer prototypical modulation plans from musical corpora. A modulation plan is formalised as a transposition-invariant probabilistic model over the underlying pitch class distributions based on a hierarchical pitch scape representation. Prototypical modulation plans can be learned in an unsupervised manner by training a mixture model (similar to a Gaussian mixture model) on the data, so that different prototypes appear as distinct clusters.We evaluate our approach by performing hierarchical clustering on a corpus of more than 150 Baroque pieces, with the extracted clusters showing excellent agreement with the most common prototypes postulated in music theory. Our method bears a great potential for modelling, analysis and discovery of hierarchical key structure and prototypes in corpora across a broad range of musical styles.

To do this, we use the co-listen\u2013based audio embeddings as inputs to small attribute classifiers, trained on a small hand-labeled dataset. These classifiers map from the original embedding space to a new interpretable attribute coordinate system that provides a more useful distance measure for downstream applications. The attributes and attribute embeddings allow us to provide a search interface and more intelligible recommendations for music curators. We examine the relative performance of these two embedding spaces (the co-listen\u2013audio embedding and the attribute embedding) for the mathematical separation of thematic playlists.

Unlike conventional deep learning approaches, which learn rhythmic patterns at the tempi present in the training dataset, the patterns learned in our model are tempo-invariant, leading to better tempo generalisation and more efficient usage of the network capacity.We test the generalisation property on a synthetic dataset created by rendering the Groove MIDI Dataset using FluidSynth, split into a training set containing the original performances and a test set containing tempo-scaled versions rendered with different SoundFonts (test-time augmentation).The proposed model generalises nearly perfectly to unseen tempi (F-measure of 0.89 on both training and test sets), whereas a comparable conventional CNN achieves similar accuracy only for the training set (0.89) and drops to 0.54 on the test set.The generalisation advantage of the proposed model extends to real music, as shown by results on the GTZAN and Ballroom datasets.",

When considering an average appreciation as an evaluation metric, user studies can be helpful. The challenge of generating personalized content, however, has been examined only rarely in the literature. In this paper, we address generation of personalized music and propose a novel pipeline for music generation that learns and optimizes user-specific musical taste. We focus on the task of symbol-based, monophonic, harmony-constrained jazz improvisations. Our personalization pipeline begins with BebopNet, a music language model trained on a corpus of jazz improvisations by Bebop giants. BebopNet is able to generate improvisations based on any given chord progression. We then assemble a personalized dataset, labeled by a specific user, and train a user-specific metric that reflects this user's unique musical taste. Finally, we employ a personalized variant of beam-search with BebopNet to optimize the generated jazz improvisations for that user. We present an extensive empirical study in which we apply this pipeline to extract individual models as implicitly defined by several human listeners. Our approach enables an objective examination of subjective personalized models whose performance is quantifiable. The results indicate that it is possible to model and optimize personal jazz preferences and offer a foundation for future research in personalized generation of art.

One approach for improving the browsing experience is music thumbnailing: the procedure of finding a continuous fragment that can represent the whole musical piece. This paper proposes a human-centred approach to creating thumbnails based on listeners' perception, directly asking listeners to identify the most characteristic fragment. We carried out a user study to assign representativeness scores to multiple fragments from a selection of popular music tracks. To strengthen the results, we performed a replication of the same user study with new participants and a different set of music. Thereafter, we used audio features, the segmentation algorithm, and participants' overall familiarity with the songs to predict representativeness scores. The results suggest that neither segmentation nor familiarity have a significant impact on users' thumbnail preferences: even segments with starting points that pay no regard to song structure can be suitable thumbnails. Three high-level audio characteristics, however, do impact the perceived representativeness of a fragment: Raw Intensity, Melodic Conventionality, and Conventionally of Intensity. Based on these findings, we propose a new, easy-to-apply method for music thumbnailing.",

We apply data augmentation to alter the chorales so that they more faithfully represent music from a broader range of choral genres. For separation we employ Wave-U-Net, a time-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) originally proposed for vocals and accompaniment separation.

We introduce score-informed Wave-U-Net to incorporate the musical score into the separation process. We experiment with different score conditioning methods and show that conditioning on the score leads to improved separation results. We propose a 'score-guided' model variant in which separation is guided by the score alone, bypassing the need to specify the identity of the extracted source. Finally, we evaluate our models (trained on synthetic data only) on real choir recordings and find that in the absence of a large training set of real recordings, NMF still performs better than Wave-U-Net in this setting.

In line with this, the AcousticBrainz platform offers a dynamically growing, open and community-contributed large-scale resource of locally computed low-level and high-level music descriptors. Beyond enabling research reuse, the availability of such an open resource allows for renewed reflection on the music descriptors we have at hand: while they were validated to perform successfully under lab conditions, they now are being run 'in the wild'. Their response to these more ecological conditions can shed light on the degree to which they truly had construct validity. In this work, we seek to gain further understanding into this, by analyzing high-level classifier-based music descriptor output in AcousticBrainz. While no hard ground truth is available on what the true value of these descriptors should be, some oracle information can still be derived, relying on semantic redundancies between several descriptors, and multiple feature submissions being available for the same recording.

We investigate how well existing systems cope with real scanned sheet music, filler pages and unrelated pieces or movements, and discontinuities due to jumps and repeats. We find that a significant bottleneck in system performance is handling jumps and repeats correctly. In particular, we find that a previously proposed Jump DTW algorithm does not perform robustly when jump locations are unknown a priori. We propose a novel alignment algorithm called Hierarchical DTW that can handle jumps and repeats even when jump locations are not known. It first performs alignment at the feature level on each sheet music line, and then performs a second alignment at the segment level. By operating at the segment level, it is able to encode domain knowledge about how likely a particular jump is. Through carefully controlled experiments on unprocessed sheet music PDFs from IMSLP, we show that Hierarachical DTW significantly outperforms Jump DTW in handling various types of jumps.",

    "description": "Much of the existing research on user aspects in the music information retrieval field tends to focus on general user needs or behavior related to music information seeking, music listening and sharing, or other use of commercial music services. However, we have a limited understanding of the personal and social contexts of music fans who enthusiastically support musicians and are often avid users of commercial music services. In this study, we aim to better understand the contextual complexities surrounding music fans through a case study of the group BTS and its fan community, ARMY. In particular, we are interested in discovering factors that influence the interactions of music fans with music services, especially in the current environment where the prevalence of social media and other tools/technologies influences musical enjoyment. Through virtual ethnography and content analysis, we identified four factors that affect music fans' interactions with commercial music services: 1) perception of music genres, 2) participatory fandom, 3) desire for agency and transparency, and 4) importance of non-musical factors. The discussion of each aspect is followed by design implications for commercial music services to consider.",

    "description": "This study examines gender representation in current music streaming, utilizing one of the world's largest streaming services. First, we found listeners generally stream fewer female or mixed-gender creator groups than male artists, with differences per genre. Second, while still relatively low, we found that recommendation-based streaming has a slightly higher proportion of female creators than \"organic\" listening (i.e., tracks that are not recommended by editors or algorithms). Third, we examined streaming data from 200,000 US users to determine the proportion of female artists in organic and recommended streams over a 28-day period and the relationship between recommended streams and users' future organic listening. The proportion of female artists in recommended streaming appears predictive of the proportion of female artists in organic streaming; these effects are moderated by gender and age. Fourth, this study also samples creators across different popularity levels, seeing more female and multi-gender groups at lower levels than in the middle tiers. However, solo female artists are better represented again in the superstars category, suggesting influence of selected superstars and genres. We conclude by discussing potential avenues in algorithmic auditing.",

These collections tend to require automatic methods for predicting such moods. In this work, we show that listening-based features outperform content-based ones when classifying moods: embeddings obtained through matrix factorization of listening data appear to be more informative of a track mood than embeddings based on its audio content. To demonstrate this, we compile a subset of the Million Song Dataset, totalling 67k tracks, with expert annotations of 188 different moods collected from AllMusic. Our results on this novel dataset not only expose the limitations of current audio-based models, but also aim to foster further reproducible research on this timely topic",

In this work, we analyze sesquialteras in bambucos from two perspectives. First, we analyze the perception of beat and meter by asking 10 Colombian musicians to perform beat annotations in a dataset of bambucos. Results show great diversity in the annotations: a total of five different meters or meter combinations were found in the annotations, with each bambuco in the study being annotated in at least two different meters. Second, we perform a beat tracking analysis in a dataset of bambucos with two state-of-the-art algorithms. Given that the algorithms used in the analysis were designed to deal with the rhythmic regularity of a single meter, it is not surprising that tracking performance is not very high (~42% mean F-measure). However, a deeper analysis of the onset detection functions used for beat tracking, indicate that there is enough information on the signal level to characterize the bi-metric behavior of bambucos. With this in mind, we highlight possibilities for computational analysis of rhythm in bambucos.",

    "description": "Music is hierarchically structured, in which the global attributes (e.g., the determined tonal structure, musical form) dominate the distribution of local elements (e.g., pitch, playing technique arrangement). Existing methods for instrumental playing technique detection mostly focus on the local features extracted from audio. However, we argue that structural information is critical for both global and local tasks, particularly considering the characteristics of Guqin music. Incorporating mode and playing technique analysis, this study demonstrates that the structural relationship between notes is crucial for detecting mode, and such information also provides extra guidance for the playing technique detection in local-level. In this study, a new dataset is compiled for Guqin performance analysis. The mode detection is achieved by pattern matching, and the predicted results are conjoined with audio features to be inputted into a neural network for playing technique detection. Advanced techniques are developed to optimize the extracted pitch contour from the audio. It is manifest in the results that the global and local features are inter-connected in Guqin music. Our analysis identifies key components affecting the recognition of mode and playing technique, and challenging cases resulting from unique properties in Guqin audio signal are discussed for further research.",

    "description": "A score-following program traces the notes in a musical score during a performance. This capability is essential to many meaningful applications that synchronize audio with a score in an on-line fashion. Existing algorithms often stumble on certain difficult cases, one of which is piano music. This paper presents a new method to tackle such cases. The method treats tempo as a variable rather than a constant (with constraints), allowing the program to adapt to live performance variations. This is first expressed by a Kalman filter model at the note level, and then by an almost equivalent switching state-space model at the audio frame level. The latter contains both discrete and continuous hidden variables, and is computationally intractable. We show how certain reasonable approximations make the computation manageable. This new method is tested on a dataset of 50 piano excerpts. Compared with a previously established state-of-the-art algorithm, the new method shows more stable and accurate results: it reduces fatal score-following errors, and improves accuracy from 65.0% to 69.1%.",

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a solution to alleviate the issue by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose an SSL method using teacher-student models for vocal melody extraction. The teacher model is pre-trained with labeled data and guides the student model to make identical predictions given unlabeled input in a self-training setting. We examine three setups of teacher-student models with different data augmentation schemes and loss functions. Also, considering the scarcity of labeled data in the test phase, we artificially generate large-scale testing data with pitch labels from unlabeled data using an analysis-synthesis method. The results show that the SSL method significantly increases the performance against supervised learning only and the improvement depends on the teacher-student models, the size of unlabeled data, the number of self-training iterations, and other training details. We also find that it is essential to ensure that the unlabeled audio has vocal parts. Finally, we show that the proposed SSL method allows a simple convolutional recurrent neural network model to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-arts.",

In this paper, we propose a framework that achieves unsupervised pitch and timbre disentanglement for isolated musical instrument sounds without relying on data annotations or pre-trained neural networks. Our framework, based on variational auto-encoders, takes as input a spectral frame, and encodes pitch and timbre as categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The input is then reconstructed by combining those variables. Under an unsupervised training setting, a major challenge is that encoders are tasked to capture factors of interest with distinct latent representations, without access to the corresponding ground-truth labels. We therefore introduce auxiliary tasks and objectives which leverage pitch shifting as a strategy to create surrogate labels, thereby encouraging the disentanglement of pitch and timbre. Through an ablation study we analyze the impact of the proposed objectives. The evaluation shows the efficacy of the proposed framework for learning disentangled representations, and verifies its applicability to unsupervised pitch classification and conditional spectral synthesis.",

    "description": "When making judgements, humans are known to be better at choosing a preferred option amongst a small number of options, rather than giving an absolute ranking of all the options. This preference-based judgment rank-ordering method is called Best-Worst Scaling (BWS). Inspired by this concept, we propose a preference-based framework to generate a relative rank-ordering of singing vocals, and therefore, singers. We adopt a twin-neural network (Siamese) that learns to choose a preferred candidate in terms of singing quality between two inputs. With a few such pairwise comparisons, this method generates a relative rank-order of a complete list of singers. Additionally, we incorporate a knowledge-based musically-relevant pitch histogram representation, as a conditioning vector, to provide explicit musical information to the network. The experiments show that this method is able to reliably evaluate singing quality and rank-order singing vocals, independent of the song or the singer. The results suggest that the twin-neural network learns the underlying discerning properties relevant to singing quality, instead of being specific to the content of a song or singer.",

Although research in deep generative models has dramatically improved the capability and fluency of music models, recent work has shown that it can be challenging for humans to partner with this new class of algorithms. In this paper, we present findings on what 13 musician/developer teams, a total of 61 users, needed when co-creating a song with AI, the challenges they faced, and how they leveraged and repurposed existing characteristics of AI to overcome some of these challenges. Many teams adopted modular approaches, such as independently running multiple smaller models that align with the musical building blocks of a song, before re-combining their results. As ML models are not easily steerable, teams also generated massive numbers of samples and curated them post-hoc, or used a range of strategies to direct the generation or algorithmically ranked the samples. Ultimately, teams not only had to manage the ``flare and focus'' aspects of the creative process, but also juggle that with a parallel process of exploring and curating multiple ML models and outputs. These findings reflect a need to design machine learning-powered music interfaces that are more decomposable, steerable, interpretable, and adaptive, which in return will enable artists to more effectively explore how AI can extend their personal expression.",

Although the latent vectors represent the characteristics of artists and songs well, they have typically been used only for computing the preference score. In this paper, we discuss how we can leverage these vectors for realizing applications that enable users to search for songs from new perspectives. To this end, by embedding song/artist vectors into the same feature space, we first propose two concepts of artist-song relationships: overall similarity and prominent affinity. Overall similarity is the degree to which the characteristics of a song are similar overall to the characteristics of the artist; while prominent affinity is the degree to which a song prominently represents the characteristics of the artist. By using Last.fm play logs for two years, we analyze the characteristics of the concepts. Moreover, based on the analysis results, we propose three applications for song search. Through case studies, we demonstrate that our proposed applications are beneficial for searching for songs according to the users' various search intents.",

Using the toolkit, we create the Altered and Corrupted MIDI Excerpts dataset version 1.0 (ACME v1.0), and propose four tasks of increasing difficulty to detect, classify, locate, and correct the degradations. We hypothesize that models trained for these tasks can be useful in (for example) improving automatic music transcription performance if applied as a post-processing step. To that end, MDTK includes a script that measures the distribution of different types of errors in a transcription, and creates a degraded dataset with similar properties. MDTK's degradations can also be applied dynamically to a dataset during training (with or without the above script), generating novel degraded excerpts each epoch. MDTK could also be used to test the robustness of any system designed to take MIDI (or similar) data as input (e.g. systems designed for voice separation, metrical alignment, or chord detection) to such transcription errors or otherwise noisy data.

These provide unprecedented accuracy across all discriminative tasks. However, the consistently overlooked downside of these models is their stunningly massive complexity, which seems concomitantly crucial to their success. In this paper, we address this issue by developing a new approach based on the recent lottery ticket hypothesis. We modify the original lottery approach to allow for explicitly removing parameters, through structured trimming of entire units, instead of simply masking individual weights. This allows to obtain models which are effectively lighter in terms of size, memory and number of operations.We show that our proposal allows to remove up to 95% of the models parameters without loss of accuracy, leading to ultra-light deep MIR models. We confirm the surprising result that, at smaller compression ratios (removing up to 90% of the network), lighter models consistently outperform their heavier counterpart. We exhibit these results on a large array of MIR tasks including audio classification, pitch recognition, chord extraction, drum transcription and onset estimation. These resulting ultra-light deep models for MIR can run on CPU, and can even fit on embedded devices with minimal degradation of accuracy.",

Our goal is to understand the influence of lyrics comprehension on music emotion perception and use this knowledge to improve Music Emotion Recognition (MER) models. We systematically analyze over 30K annotations of 22 musical fragments to assess the impact of individual differences on agreement, as defined by Krippendorff's coefficient. We employ personal characteristics to form group-based annotations by assembling ratings with respect to listeners' familiarity, preference, lyrics comprehension, and music sophistication. Finally, we study our group-based annotations in a two-fold approach: (1) assessing the similarity within annotations using manifold learning algorithms and unsupervised clustering, and (2) analyzing their performance by training classification models with diverse \"ground truths\". Our results suggest that a) applying a broader categorization of taxonomies and b) using multi-label, group-based annotations based on language, can be beneficial for MER models.",

Given these difficulties, it is not easy to learn good feature representations with supervised learning techniques, either because of the insufficiency of labels, or the subjectiveness (and hence large variance) in human-annotated labels. In this paper, we present a framework that can learn high-level feature representations with a limited amount of data, by first modelling their corresponding quantifiable low-level attributes. We refer to our proposed framework as Music FaderNets, which is inspired by the fact that low-level attributes can be continuously manipulated by separate \"sliding faders\" through feature disentanglement and latent regularization techniques. High-level features are then inferred from the low-level representations through semi-supervised clustering using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (GM-VAEs). Using arousal as an example of a high-level feature, we show that the \"faders\" of our model are disentangled and change linearly w.r.t. the modelled low-level attributes of the generated output music. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model successfully learns the intrinsic relationship between arousal and its corresponding low-level attributes (rhythm and note density), with only 1% of the training set being labelled. Finally, using the learnt high-level feature representations, we explore the application of our framework in style transfer tasks across different arousal states.

We study whether we can classify mode in a corpus of 20,865 medieval plainchant melodies from the Cantus database. We revisit the traditional 'textbook' classification approach (using the final, the range and initial note) as well as the only prior computational study we are aware of, which uses pitch profiles. Both approaches work well, but largely reduce modes to scales and ignore their melodic character. Our main contribution is a model that reaches 93\u201395% F1 score on mode classification, compared to 86\u201390% using traditional pitch-based musicological methods. Importantly, it reaches 81\u201383% even when we discard all absolute pitch information and reduce a melody to its contour. The model uses tf\u2013idf vectors and strongly depends on the choice of units: i.e., how the melody is segmented. If we borrow the syllable or word structure from the lyrics, the model outperforms all of our baselines.

    "description": "In this paper, we describe a workflow of successive corrections on Optical Music Recognition (OMR) generated MusicXML files and their respective outputs under Music Information Retrieval tasks. The original OMR-generated files of six Mendelssohn String Quartets were initially corrected by individual members of this interdisciplinary group, then reviewed by others to further standardize the quality and music analysis priorities of the team. Four MIR tasks are applied to each round of corrections on this collection: cadence detection, chord labeling, key finding, and monophonic pattern discovery.We measure changes in the outputs of these four MIR tasks from one round of correction to the next in order to evaluate the impact of corrections. Results show that expert revision is more beneficial to some MIR tasks than to others. The resulting corpus of curated MusicXML files is available as an open-source repository under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for further MIR research.",

    "description": "We introduce CONLON, a pattern-based MIDI generation method that employs a new lossless pianoroll-like data description in which velocities and durations are stored in separate channels. CONLON uses Wasserstein autoencoders as the underlying generative model. Its generation strategy is similar to interpolation, where MIDI pseudo-songs are obtained by concatenating patterns decoded from smooth trajectories in the embedding space, but aims to produce a smooth result in the pattern space by computing optimal trajectories as the solution of a widest-path problem. A set of surveys enrolling 69 professional musicians shows that our system, when trained on datasets of carefully selected and coherent patterns, is able to produce pseudo-songs that are musically consistent and potentially useful for professional musicians.

The loops originate from Freesound, a community database of audio recordings released under Creative Commons licenses, so the audio in our dataset may be redistributed. The annotations include instrument, meter, key and genre tags. We describe the methodology used to assemble and annotate the data, and report on the distribution of tags in the data and inter-annotator agreement. We also present to the community an online loop annotator tool that we developed. To illustrate the usefulness of FSLD, we present short case studies on using it to estimate tempo and key, generate new loops, and evaluate a loop separation algorithm.

By learning to encode entire recordings into plain vector embeddings, recent systems have made significant progress in bridging the gap between accuracy and scalability, which has been a key challenge for nearly two decades. In this work, we propose to further narrow this gap by employing a set of data distillation techniques that reduce the embedding dimensionality of a pre-trained state-of-the-art model. We compare a wide range of techniques and propose new ones, from classical dimensionality reduction to more sophisticated distillation schemes. With those, we obtain 99% smaller embeddings that, moreover, yield up to a 3% accuracy increase. Such small embeddings can have an important impact in retrieval time, up to the point of making a real-world system practical on a standalone laptop.",

However, the past approaches often neglect the fact that many of these tags largely depend on the user, especially the tags related to the context of music listening. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a user-aware music auto-tagging system and evaluation protocol. Specifically, we use both the audio content and user information extracted from the user listening history to predict contextual tags for a given user/track pair. We propose a new dataset of music tracks annotated with contextual tags per user. We compare our model to the traditional audio-based model and study the influence of user embeddings on the classification quality. Our work shows that explicitly modeling the user listening history into the automatic tagging process could lead to more accurate estimation of contextual tags.",

    "description": "Most commercial music services rely on collaborative filtering to recommend artists and songs. While this method is effective for popular artists with large fanbases, it can present difficulties for recommending novel, lesser known artists due to a relative lack of user preference data. In this paper, we therefore seek to understand how content-based approaches can be used to more effectively recommend songs from these lesser known artists. Specifically, we conduct a user study to answer three questions. Firstly, do most users agree which songs are most acoustically similar? Secondly, is acoustic similarity a good proxy for how an individual might construct a playlist or recommend music to a friend? Thirdly, if so, can we find acoustic features that are related to human judgments of acoustic similarity? To answer these questions, our study asked 117 test subjects to compare two unknown candidate songs relative to a third known reference song. Our findings show that 1) judgments about acoustic similarity are fairly consistent, 2) acoustic similarity is highly correlated with playlist selection and recommendation, but not necessarily personal preference, and 3) we identify a subset of acoustic features from the Spotify Web API that is particularly predictive of human similarity judgments.",

We represent music as a sequence of edit events, each of which denotes either the addition or removal of a note---even a note previously generated by the model. During inference, we generate one edit event at a time using direct ancestral sampling. Our approach allows the model to fix previous mistakes such as incorrectly sampled notes and prevent accumulation of errors which autoregressive models are prone to have. Another benefit of our approach is a finer degree of control during human and AI collaboration as our approach is notewise online. We show through quantitative metrics and human survey evaluation that our approach generates better results than orderless NADE and Gibbs sampling approaches.",

We address the major challenges of ensemble singing, i.e., all melodic sources are vocals and singers sing in harmony. We build upon an existing architecture to produce a pitch salience function of the input signal, where the harmonic constant-Q transform (HCQT) and its associated phase differentials are used as an input representation. The pitch salience function is subsequently thresholded to obtain a multiple F0 estimation output. For training, we build a dataset that comprises several multi-track datasets of vocal quartets with F0 annotations.This work proposes and evaluates a set of CNNs for this task in diverse scenarios and data configurations, including recordings with additional reverb. Our models outperform a state-of-the-art method intended for the same music genre when evaluated with an increased F0 resolution, as well as a general-purpose method for multi-F0 estimation.

    "description": "Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments.",

    "description": "Human annotation is still an essential part of modern transcription workflows for digitizing music scores, either as a standalone approach where a single expert annotator transcribes a complete score, or for supporting an automated Optical Music Recognition (OMR) system. Research on human computation has shown the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for scaling out human work by defining a large number of microtasks which can easily be distributed and executed. However, microtask design for music transcription is a research area that remains unaddressed. This paper focuses on the design of a crowdsourcing task to detect errors in a score transcription which can be deployed in either automated or human-driven transcription workflows. We conduct an experiment where we study two design parameters: 1) the size of the score to be annotated and 2) the modality in which it is presented in the user interface. We analyze the performance and reliability of non-specialised crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk with respect to these design parameters, differentiated by worker experience and types of transcription errors. Results are encouraging, and pave the way for scalable and efficient crowd-assisted music transcription systems.",

    "description": "Choral singing is a widely practiced form of ensemble singing wherein a group of people sing simultaneously in polyphonic harmony. The most commonly practiced setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies (F0s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails separating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for musical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies have been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused on a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass sources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In contrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to high structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the sources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task than the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated dataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far. In this paper we first assess how well some of the recently developed methodologies for musical source separation perform for the case of SATB choirs. We then propose a novel domain-specific adaptation for conditioning the recently proposed U-Net architecture for musical source separation using the fundamental frequency contour of each of the singing groups and demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses results from domain-agnostic architectures.",

More specifically, listeners were asked to describe, using freely chosen words (preferably: adjectives), how they perceive the expressive character of the different performances. In this paper, we offer a first account of this new data resource for expressive performance research, and provide an exploratory analysis, addressing three main questions: (1) how similarly do different listeners describe a performance of a piece? (2) what are the main dimensions (or axes) for expressive character emerging from this?; and (3) how do measurable parameters of a performance (e.g., tempo, dynamics) and mid- and high-level features that can be predicted by machine learning models (e.g., articulation, arousal) relate to these expressive dimensions?

Two central methods for representation learning include deep metric learning and classification, both having the same goal of learning a representation that can generalize well across tasks. Along with generalization, the emerging concept of disentangled representations is also of great interest, where multiple semantic concepts (e.g., genre, mood, instrumentation) are learned jointly but remain separable in the learned representation space. In this paper we present a single representation learning framework that elucidates the relationship between metric learning, classification, and disentanglement in a holistic manner. For this, we (1) outline past work on the relationship between metric learning and classification, (2) extend this relationship to multi-label data by exploring three different learning approaches and their disentangled versions, and (3) evaluate all models on four tasks (training time, similarity retrieval, auto-tagging, and triplet prediction). We find that classification-based models are generally advantageous for training time, similarity retrieval, and auto-tagging, while deep metric learning exhibits better performance for triplet-prediction.

We also asked participants a series of free-form questions on music discovery and diversity in semi-structured interviews. User-preferred levels of diversity varied widely both within and between subjects. Although most users agreed that diversity is beneficial in music discovery, they also noted a risk of dissatisfaction from too much diversity. A key finding is that preference for diversification was often linked to user mood. Participants also expressed a clear distinction between diversity within existing preferences, and outside of existing preferences.

    "description": "Labeling a music recording according to its genre is an intuitive and familiar way to describe its content. Music genres are valuable information, especially for music organization, personalized listening experience, and playlist generation. Automatically classifying music genres is a challenging endeavor due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. Most efforts on music genre classification consider the complete independence between labels. However, music genres typically respect a hierarchical structure based on the influences or origins of each style. Conversely, many of the methods available for hierarchical classification are based on assumptions about the class hierarchy, such as the need for multiple children in each hierarchy's node, which may limit their use in music applications. Also, the local classifier per node approach that would be the most suitable for this scenario is costly regarding time and memory. In this paper, we present two local hierarchical classification approaches and show how to combine them to obtain a single one that is more robust and faithful to the music genre classification scenario. We evaluate our proposal in a music dataset hierarchically labeled with 120 music genres. As shown, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach has a lower computational cost and can achieve competitive performances.",

While we are able to reduce the training loss to a low value, our listening test suggests however a clear gap between the average ratings of the generated and real compositions. We therefore go one step further and conduct a series of computational analysis of the generated compositions from different perspectives. This includes analyzing the statistics of the pitch class, grooving, and chord progression, assessing the structureness of the music with the help of the fitness scape plot, and evaluating the model's understanding of Jazz music through a MIREX-like continuation prediction task. Our work presents in an analytical manner why machine-generated music to date still falls short of the artwork of humanity, and sets some goals for future work on automatic composition to further pursue.",

    "description": "Recent advances in polyphonic piano transcription have been made primarily by a deliberate design of neural network architectures that detect different note states such as onset or sustain and model the temporal evolution of the states. The majority of them, however, use separate neural networks for each note state, thereby optimizing multiple loss functions, and also they handle the temporal evolution of note states by abstract connections between the state-wise neural networks or using a post-processing module. In this paper, we propose a unified neural network architecture where multiple note states are predicted as a softmax output with a single loss function and the temporal order is learned by an auto-regressive connection within the single neural network. This compact model allows to increase note states without architectural complexity. Using the MAESTRO dataset, we examine various combinations of multiple note states including on, onset, sustain, re-onset, offset, and off. We also show that the autoregressive module effectively learns inter-state dependency of notes. Finally, we show that our proposed model achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-arts with fewer parameters.",

    "description": "Audio alignment is a fundamental preprocessing step in many MIR pipelines. For two audio clips with M and N frames, respectively, the most popular approach, dynamic time warping (DTW), has O(MN) requirements in both memory and computation, which is prohibitive for frame-level alignments at reasonable rates. To address this, a variety of memory efficient algorithms exist to approximate the optimal alignment under the DTW cost. To our knowledge, however, no exact algorithms exist that are guaranteed to break the quadratic memory barrier. In this work, we present a divide and conquer algorithm that computes the exact globally optimal DTW alignment using O(M+N) memory. Its runtime is still O(MN), trading off memory for a 2x increase in computation. However, the algorithm can be parallelized up to a factor of min(M, N) with the same memory constraints, so it can still run more efficiently than the textbook version with an adequate GPU. We use our algorithm to compute exact alignments on a collection of orchestral music, which we use as ground truth to benchmark the alignment accuracy of several popular approximate alignment schemes at scales that were not previously possible.",

    "description": "Recent years have witnessed great progress in using deep learning algorithms to learn to compose music in the form of a MIDI file. However, whether such algorithms apply equally well to compose guitar tabs, which are quite different from MIDIs, remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we build a model for composing fingerstyle guitar tabs with a neural sequence model architecture called the Transformer-XL. With this model, we investigate the following research questions. First, whether the neural net generates note sequences with meaningful fingering (i.e., string-fret combinations), which is important for tabs but not for MIDIs. Second, whether it generates compositions with coherent rhythmic grooving, which is crucial for fingerstyle guitar music. And, finally, how pleasant the composed music is in comparison to real, human-made compositions. Our work provides preliminary empirical evidence for the promise of deep learning for guitar tab composition, and suggests areas for future study.",

    "description": "A DJ mix is a sequence of music tracks concatenated seamlessly, typically rendered for audiences in a live setting by a DJ on stage. As a DJ mix is produced in a studio or the live version is recorded for music streaming services, computational methods to analyze DJ mixes, for example, extracting track information or understanding DJ techniques, have drawn research interests. Many of previous works are, however, limited to identifying individual tracks in a mix or segmenting it, and the sizes of the datasets are usually small. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of DJ music by aligning a mix to its original music tracks. We set up the subsequence alignment such that the audio features are less sensitive to the tempo or key change of the original track in a mix. This approach provides temporally tight mix-to-track matching from which we can obtain cue-points, transition length, mix segmentation, and musical changes in DJ performance. Using 1,557 mixes from 1001Tracklists including 13,728 tracks and 20,765 transitions, we conduct the proposed analysis and show a wide range of statistics, which may elucidate the creative process of DJ music making.",

Utilization of relevant context in audio sequence is essential for effective prediction. Existing methods have used LSTMs with modest success. In this work we describe three attentive LSTM based approaches for dynamic emotion prediction from music clips. We validate our models through extensive experimentation on standard dataset annotated with arousal-valence values in continuous time, and choose the best performer. We find that the LSTM based attention models perform better than the state of the art transformers for the dynamic emotion prediction task, both in terms of R2 and Kendall-Tau metrics. We explore individual smaller feature sets in search of a more effective one and to understand how different features contribute to perceived emotion. The spectral features are found to perform at par with the generic ComPare feature set [1]. Through attention map analysis we visualize how attention is distributed over music clips' frames for emotion prediction. It is observed that the models attend to frames which contribute to changes in reported arousal-valence values and chroma to produce better emotion predictions, effectively capturing long-term dependencies.",

Both an onset time and an accent time is associated to each state. The systematic inference of the reduced form is formalized. This enables the specification of a rhythmic structural similarity measure on drum patterns, where reduced patterns are compared through alignment. The two-state representation allows a low computational cost alignment, once the complex topological formalization is fully taken into account. A comparison with the Hamming distance, as well as similarity ratings collected from listeners on a drum loop dataset, indicates that the bistate reduction enables to convey subtle aspects that goes beyond surface-level comparison of rhythmic textures.",

Real-world events play a key role in shaping collective sentiment in a society. As people listen to music daily everywhere in the world, the sentiment of music being listened to can reflect the mood of the listeners and serve as a measure of collective sentiment. However, the exact relationship between real-world events and the sentiment of music being listened to is not clear. Driven by this research gap, we use the unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 as a natural experiment to explore how users' sentiment of music being listened to evolves before and during the outbreak of the pandemic. We employ causal inference approaches on an extended version of the LFM-1b dataset of listening events shared on Last.fm, to examine the impact of the pandemic on the sentiment of music listened to by users in different countries. We find that, after the first COVID-19 case in a country was confirmed, the sentiment of artists users listened to becomes more negative. This negative effect is pronounced for males while females' music emotion is less influenced by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further find a negative association between the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases and users' music sentiment. Our results provide empirical evidence that public sentiment can be monitored based on collective music listening behaviors, which can contribute to research in related disciplines.",

We present a new, diverse tabla dataset suitably annotated for the task. The acoustic correspondence between the tabla stroke categories and the common popular Western drum types motivates us to adapt models and methods from automatic drum transcription. We start by exploring the use of transfer learning on a state-of-the-art pre-trained multiclass CNN drums model. This is compared with 1-way models trained separately for each tabla stroke class. We find that the 1-way models provide the best mean f-score while the drums pre-trained and tabla-adapted 3-way models generalize better for the most scarce target class.

    "description": "Most of the musical heritage is only available as physical documents, given that the engraving process was carried out by handwriting or typesetting until the end of the 20th century. Their mere availability as scanned images does not enable tasks such as indexing or editing unless they are transcribed into a structured digital format. Given the cost and time required for manual transcription, Optical Music Recognition (OMR) presents itself as a promising alternative. Quite often, OMR systems show acceptable but not perfect performance, which eventually leaves them out of the transcription process. On the assumption that OMR systems might always make some errors, it is essential that the user corrects the output. This paper contributes to a better understanding of how music transcription is improved by the assistance of OMR systems that include the end-user in the recognition process. For that, we have measured the transcription time of a printed early music work under two scenarios: a manual one and a state-of-the-art OMR-assisted one, with several alternatives each. Our results demonstrate that using OMR remarkably reduces users' effort, even when its performance is far optimal, compared to the fully manual option.",

We then show that the resulting model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art single-task models when trained on the same datasets. Additionally, we evaluate a broad range of augmentation methods and find that extending augmentation policies to include a more diverse set of methods further improves accuracy. Finally, we train both the proposed and state-of-the-art single-task models on differently sized training datasets and different augmentation policies and compare the differences in generalization performance.",

    "description": "Sections of guitar parts in pop/rock songs are commonly described by functional terms including for example rhythm guitar, lead guitar, solo or riff. At a low level, these terms generally involve textural properties, for example whether the guitar tends to play chords or single notes. At a higher level, they indicate the function the guitar is playing relative to other instruments of the ensemble, for example whether the guitar is accompanying in background, or if it is intended to play a part in the foreground. Automatic labelling of instrumental function has various potential applications including the creation of consistent datasets dedicated to the training of generative models that focus on a particular function. In this paper, we propose a computational method to identify rhythm guitar sections in symbolic tablatures. We define rhythm guitar as sections that aim at making the listener perceive the chord progression that characterizes the harmony part of the song. A set of 31 high level features is proposed to predict if a bar in a tablature should be labeled as rhythm guitar or not. These features are used by an LSTM classifier which yields to a F1 score of 0.95 on a dataset of 102 guitar tablatures with manual function annotations.

However, there are still a number of open problems, such as a lack of robustness in the face of severe duration mismatches between audio and lyrics representation; a certain degree of language-specificity caused by acoustic differences across languages; and the fact that most successful methods in the field are not suited to work in real-time. Real-time lyrics alignment (tracking) would have many useful applications, such as fully automated subtitle display in live concerts and opera. In this work, we describe the first real-time-capable audio-to-lyrics alignment pipeline that is able to robustly track the lyrics of different languages, without additional language information. The proposed model predicts, for each audio frame, a probability vector over (European) phoneme classes, using a very small temporal context, and aligns this vector with a phoneme posteriogram matrix computed beforehand from another recording of the same work, which serves as a reference and a proxy to the written-out lyrics. We evaluate our system's tracking accuracy on the challenging genre of classical opera. Finally, robustness to out-of-training languages is demonstrated in an experiment on Jingju (Beijing opera).",

Recently, this task has been formulated as a supervised learning problem, specifically by means of Convolutional Neural Networks due to their high performance and generalization capability. However, the requirement of training data for each new type of document still represents an important drawback. This issue can be palliated through Domain Adaptation (DA), which is the field that aims to adapt the knowledge learned with an annotated collection of data to other domains for which labels are not available. In this work, we combine a DA strategy based on adversarial training with Selectional Auto-Encoders to define an unsupervised framework for document analysis. Our experiments show a remarkable improvement for the layers that depict particular features at each domain, whereas layers that depict common features (such as staff lines) are barely affected by the adaptation process.

To determine if Jukebox's representations contain useful information for MIR, we use them as input features to train shallow models on several MIR tasks. Relative to representations from conventional MIR models which are pre-trained on tagging, we find that using representations from Jukebox as input features yields 30% stronger performance on average across four MIR tasks: tagging, genre classification, emotion recognition, and key detection. For key detection, we observe that representations from Jukebox are considerably stronger than those from models pre-trained on tagging, suggesting that pre-training via codified audio language modeling may address blind spots in conventional approaches. We interpret the strength of Jukebox's representations as evidence that modeling audio instead of tags provides richer representations for MIR.",

We achieve so with three major technical contributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally proposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second, we propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar encoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and future context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform look-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before predicting the other attributes of the note.

Based on this, we propose a user-controllable framework that uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to harmonize the melody based on the given chord surprise indication. Through explicit conditions, the model can randomly generate various and harmonic chord progressions for a melody, and the Spearman's correlation and p-value significance show that the resulting chord progressions match the given surprise contour quite well. The vanilla CVAE model was evaluated in a basic melody harmonization task (no surprise control) in terms of six objective metrics.

Musicians can flexibly adapt their string choice, hand position, and finger placement to maximise expressivity and playability when sounding each note. Violin fingerings therefore serve as important guides in ensuring effective performance, especially for inexperienced players. However, fingering annotations are often missing or only partially available on violin sheet music. Here, we propose a model based on the variational autoencoder that generates violin fingering patterns using only pitch and timing information found on the score. Our model leverages limited existing fingering data with the possibility to learn in a semi-supervised manner. Results indicate that fingering annotations generated by our model successfully imitate the style and preferences of a human performer. We further show its significantly improved performance with semi-supervised learning, and demonstrate our model's ability to match the state-of-the-art in violin fingering pattern generation when trained on only half the amount of labelled data.",

In the present work, we analyze several sets of features on their effectiveness in predicting arousal and valence of six different performances (by six famous pianists) of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier Book 1. These features include low-level acoustic features, score-based features, features extracted using a pre-trained emotion model, and Mid-level perceptual features. We compare their predictive power by evaluating them on several experiments designed to test performance-wise or piece-wise variations of emotion. We find that Mid-level features show significant contribution in performance-wise variation of both arousal and valence - even better than the pre-trained emotion model. Our findings add to the evidence of Mid-level perceptual features being an important representation of musical attributes for several tasks - specifically, in this case, for capturing the expressive aspects of music that manifest as perceived emotion of a musical performance.",

The motivation for this approach is twofold: (1) it approximates a maximally informative contour representation (capturing most of the variation in as few dimensions as possible), but (2) it is nevertheless independent of the specifics of the data sets for which it is used. We consider the relation with principal component analysis, which only meets the first of these requirements. Theoretically, the principal components of a repertoire of random walks are known to be cosines. We find, empirically, that the principal components of melodies also closely approximate cosines in multiple musical traditions. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed representation by analyzing contours at three levels (complete songs, melodic phrases and melodic motifs) across multiple traditions in three small case studies.",

This paper introduces MusicFrameworks, a hierarchical music structure representation and a multi-step generative process to create a full-length melody guided by long-term repetitive structure, chord, melodic contour, and rhythm constraints. We first organize the full melody with section and phrase-level structure. To generate melody in each phrase, we generate rhythm and basic melody using two separate transformer-based networks, and then generate the melody conditioned on the basic melody, rhythm and chords in an auto-regressive manner. By factoring music generation into sub-problems, our approach allows simpler models and requires less data. To customize or add variety, one can alter chords, basic melody, and rhythm structure in the music frameworks, letting our networks generate the melody accordingly. Additionally, we introduce new features to encode musical positional information, rhythm patterns, and melodic contours based on musical domain knowledge. A listening test reveals that melodies generated by our method are rated as good as or better than human-composed music in the POP909 dataset about half the time.",

    "description": "This paper makes several contributions to automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) research. Our main contribution is a novel variant of the Multistreaming Time-Delay Neural Network (MTDNN) architecture, called MSTRE-Net, which processes the temporal information using multiple streams in parallel with varying resolutions keeping the network more compact, and thus with a faster inference and an improved recognition rate than having identical TDNN streams. In addition, two novel preprocessing steps prior to training the acoustic model are proposed. First, we suggest using recordings from both monophonic and polyphonic domains during training the acoustic model. Second, we tag monophonic and polyphonic recordings with distinct labels for discriminating non-vocal silence and music instances during alignment. Moreover, we present a new test set with a considerably larger size and a higher musical variability compared to the existing datasets used in ALT literature, while maintaining the gender balance of the singers. Our best performing model sets the state-of-the-art in lyrics transcription by a large margin. For reproducibility, we publicly share the identifiers to retrieve the data used in this paper.",

    "description": "Modern keyboards allow a musician to play multiple instruments at the same time by assigning zones\u2014fixed pitch ranges of the keyboard\u2014to different instruments. In this paper, we aim to further extend this idea and examine the feasibility of automatic instrumentation\u2014dynamically assigning instruments to notes in solo music during performance. In addition to the online, real-time-capable setting for performative use cases, automatic instrumentation can also find applications in assistive composing tools in an offline setting. Due to the lack of paired data of original solo music and their full arrangements, we approach automatic instrumentation by learning to separate parts (e.g., voices, instruments and tracks) from their mixture in symbolic multitrack music, assuming that the mixture is to be played on a keyboard. We frame the task of part separation as a sequential multi-class classification problem and adopt machine learning to map sequences of notes into sequences of part labels. To examine the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation over four diverse datasets of different genres and ensembles\u2014Bach chorales, string quartets, game music and pop music. Our experiments show that the proposed models outperform various baselines. We also demonstrate the potential for our proposed models to produce alternative convincing instrumentations for an existing arrangement by separating its mixture into parts.

    "description": "Previous work has shown that neural architectures are able to perform optical music recognition (OMR) on monophonic and homophonic music with high accuracy. However, piano and orchestral scores frequently exhibit polyphonic passages, which add a second dimension to the task. Monophonic and homophonic music can be described as homorhythmic, or having a single musical rhythm. Polyphonic music, on the other hand, can be seen as having multiple rhythmic sequences, or voices, concurrently. We first introduce a workflow for creating large-scale polyphonic datasets suitable for end-to-end recognition from sheet music publicly available on the MuseScore forum. We then propose two novel formulations for end-to-end polyphonic OMR---one treating the problem as a type of multi-task binary classification, and the other treating it as multi-sequence detection. Building upon the encoder-decoder architecture and an image encoder proposed in past work on end-to-end OMR, we propose two novel decoder models---FlagDecoder and RNNDecoder---that correspond to the two formulations. Finally, we compare the empirical performance of these end-to-end approaches to polyphonic OMR and observe a new state-of-the-art performance with our multi-sequence detection decoder, RNNDecoder.",

    "description": "This paper presents a Hardanger fiddle dataset \"HF1\" with polyphonic performances spanning five different emotional expressions: normal, angry, sad, happy, and tender. The performances thus cover the four quadrants of the activity/valence-space. The onsets and offsets, together with an associated pitch, were human-annotated for each note in each performance by the fiddle players themselves. First, they annotated the normal version. These annotations were then transferred to the expressive performances using music alignment and finally human-verified. Two separate music alignment methods based on image registration were developed for this purpose; a B-spline implementation that produces a continuous temporal transformation curve and a Demons algorithm that produces displacement matrices for time and pitch that also account for local timing variations across the pitch range. Both methods start from an \"Onsetgram\" of onset salience across pitch and time and perform the alignment task accurately. Various settings of the Demons algorithm were further evaluated in an ablation study. The final dataset is around 43 minutes long and consists of 19 734 notes of Hardanger fiddle music, recorded in stereo. The dataset and source code are available online. The dataset will be used in MIR research for tasks involving polyphonic transcription, score alignment, beat tracking, downbeat tracking, tempo estimation, and classification of emotional expressions.",

    "description": "Voice leading is considered to play an important role in the structure of Western tonal music. However, the explicit voice assignment of a piece (if present at all) generally does not reflect all phenomena related to voice leading. Instead, voice-leading phenomena can occur in free textures (e.g., in most keyboard music), or cut across the explicitly notated voices (e.g., through implicit polyphony within a single voice). This paper presents a model of proto-voices, voice-like structures that encode sequential and vertical relations between notes without the need to assume explicit voices. Proto-voices are constructed by recursive combination of primitive structural operations, such as insertion of neighbor or passing notes, or horizontalization of simultaneous notes. Together, these operations give rise to a grammar-like hierarchical system that can be used to infer the structural fabric of a piece using a chart parsing algorithm. Such a model can serve as a foundation for defining higher-level latent entities (such as harmonies or voice-leading schemata), explicitly linking them to their realizations on the musical surface.",

We find paths in the graph between a seed and a target item; we score those paths based on their interestingness; and we aggregate those scores to determine the similarity between the seed and the target. A distinguishing feature of our similarity measure is its interpretability. In particular, we can translate the most interesting paths into natural language, so that the causes of the similarity judgements can be readily understood by humans. We compare the accuracy of our similarity measure with other competitive path-based similarity baselines in two experimental settings and with four datasets. The results highlight the validity of our approach to music similarity, and demonstrate that path interestingness scores can be the basis of an accurate and interpretable similarity measure.",

Personalized models are trained in a supervised manner, and are tested exclusively with the annotations provided by a specific user. While past research has focused on model adaptation or reducing the amount of annotations required from a given user, we propose a novel methodology based on uncertainty sampling and query-by-committee methods, adopting prior knowledge from the agreement of human annotations as an oracle for active learning. We assume that our disagreements define our personal opinions and should be considered for personalization. We use the DEAM dataset, the current benchmark dataset for MER, to pre-train our models. We then use the AMG1608 dataset, the largest MER dataset containing multiple annotations per musical excerpt, to re-train diverse machine learning models using active learning and evaluate personalization.

We demonstrate that the model can learn to translate spectrogram inputs directly to MIDI-like output events for several transcription tasks. This sequence-to-sequence approach simplifies transcription by jointly modeling audio features and language-like output dependencies, thus removing the need for task-specific architectures.

We introduce a workflow paradigm for remote consensus-building between expert annotators, while considerably reducing the associated administrative overhead through automation. Most music annotation tasks rely heavily on human interpretation and therefore defy the concept of an objective and indisputable ground truth. Thus, our paradigm invites and documents inter-annotator controversy based on a transparent set of analytical criteria, and aims at putting forth the consensual solutions emerging from such deliberations. The workflow that we suggest traces the entire genesis of annotation data, including the relevant discussions between annotators, reviewers, and curators. It adopts a well-proven pattern from collaborative software development, namely distributed version control, and allows for the automation of repetitive maintenance tasks, such as validity checks, message dispatch, or updates of meta- and paradata. To demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness, we introduce one possible implementation through GitHub Actions and showcase its success in creating cadence, phrase, and harmony annotations for a corpus of 36 trio sonatas by Arcangelo Corelli.

Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships across time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times subjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information in real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently. In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter tracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The proposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to perform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the predictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to significantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the inference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based methods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training, show that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking systems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.",

Whereas estimation of the pitches and onset times of musical notes has been improved drastically thanks to the recent advances of deep learning, estimation of note values and voice labels, which is a crucial component of the APT system, still remains a challenging task. A previous study has revealed that (i) the pitches and onset times of notes are useful but the performed note durations are less informative for estimating the note values and that (ii) the note values and voices have mutual dependency. We thus propose a bidirectional long short-term memory network that jointly estimates note values and voice labels from note pitches and onset times estimated in advance. To improve the robustness against tempo errors, extra notes, and missing notes included in the input data, we investigate data augmentation. The experimental results show the efficacy of multi-task learning and data augmentation, and the proposed method achieved better accuracies than existing methods.",

We re-examine current best practices for large-scale sheet music retrieval through an economics perspective. In our analogy, the runtime search is like a consumer shopping in a store. The items on the shelves correspond to fingerprints, and purchasing an item corresponds to doing a fingerprint lookup in the database. From this perspective, we show that previous approaches are extremely inefficient marketplaces in which the consumer has very few choices and adopts an irrational buying strategy. The main contribution of this work is to propose a novel fingerprinting scheme called marketplace fingerprinting. This approach redesigns the system to be an efficient marketplace in which the consumer has many options and adopts a rational buying strategy that explicitly considers the cost and expected utility of each item. We also show that deciding which fingerprints to include in the database poses a type of minimax problem in which the store and the consumer have competing interests. On experiments using all solo piano sheet music images in IMSLP as a searchable database, we show that marketplace fingerprinting substantially outperforms previous approaches and achieves a mean reciprocal rank of 0.905 with sub-second average runtime.",

Learning the cross-domain embedding was previously attempted with a triplet-based similarity model where vocal and mixed audio are encoded by two different convolutional neural networks. We improve the approach with a structure-preserving triplet loss that exploits not only cross-domain similarity between vocal and mixed audio but also intra-domain similarity within vocal tracks or mix tracks. We learn vocal embedding using a large-scaled dataset and evaluate it in singer identification and query-by-singer tasks.

    "description": "Deep neural network based methods have been successfully applied to music source separation. They typically learn a mapping from a mixture spectrogram to a set of source spectrograms, all with magnitudes only. This approach has several limitations: 1) its incorrect phase reconstruction degrades the performance, 2) it limits the magnitude of masks between 0 and 1 while we observe that 22% of time-frequency bins have ideal ratio mask values of over~1 in a popular dataset, MUSDB18, 3) its potential on very deep architectures is under-explored. Our proposed system is designed to overcome these. First, we propose to estimate phases by estimating complex ideal ratio masks (cIRMs) where we decouple the estimation of cIRMs into magnitude and phase estimations. Second, we extend the separation method to effectively allow the magnitude of the mask to be larger than~1. Finally, we propose a residual UNet architecture with up to 143 layers.

    "description": "The positive impact of music on people's mental health and wellbeing has been well researched in music psychology, but there is a dearth of research exploring the implications of these benefits for the design of commercial music services (CMS). In this paper, we investigate how popular music can support the listener's mental health through a case study of fans of the music group BTS, with a goal of understanding how they perceive and describe the way music is influencing their mental health. We aim to derive specific design implications for CMS to facilitate such support for fans' mental health and wellbeing. Through an online survey of 1190 responses, we identify and discuss the patterns of seven different mood regulations along with major themes on fans' lived experiences of how BTS's music (1) provides comfort, (2) catalyzes self-growth, and (3) facilitates coping. We conclude the study with discussion of four specific suggestions for CMS features incorporating (1) visual elements, (2) non-music media, (3) user-generated content for collective sense-making, and (4) metadata related to mood and lyrical content that can facilitate the mental health support provided by popular music.",

    "description": "Do people from different cultural backgrounds perceive the mood in music the same way? How closely do human ratings across different cultures approximate automatic mood detection algorithms that are often trained on corpora of predominantly Western popular music? Analyzing 166 participants' responses from Brazil, South Korea, and the US, we examined the similarity between the ratings of nine categories of perceived moods in music and estimated their alignment with four popular mood detection algorithms. We created a dataset of 360 recent pop songs drawn from major music charts of the countries and constructed semantically identical mood descriptors across English, Korean, and Portuguese languages. Multiple participants from the three countries rated their familiarity, preference, and perceived moods for a given song. Ratings were highly similar within and across cultures for basic mood attributes such as sad, cheerful, and energetic. However, we found significant cross-cultural differences for more complex characteristics such as dreamy and love. To our surprise, the results of mood detection algorithms were uniformly correlated across human ratings from all three countries and did not show a detectable bias towards any particular culture. Our study thus suggests that the mood detection algorithms can be considered as an objective measure at least within the popular music context.",

The wide-ranging consequences of reflexivity on the future of scholarly inquiry combined with the near-universal contemporary recognition of the need to broaden the scope of MIR research invite and merit critical attention. To that end, focusing primarily on twelve-tone equal-tempered pitch and dyadic rhythm models, we explore the practical, cultural, perceptual, historical, and epistemological consequences of these pervasive quantizations. We analyze several case studies of meaningful and successful past research that balanced practicality with methodological validity in order to posit several best practices for both future intercultural studies and research centered on more narrowly constructed corpora. We conclude with a discussion of the dangers of solutionism on the one hand and the self-fulfilling prophecies of status quoism on the other as well as an emphasis on the need for intellectual honesty in metatheoretical discourse.",

    "description": "We propose a unified model for three inter-related tasks: 1) to separate individual sound sources from a mixed music audio, 2) to transcribe each sound source to MIDI notes, and 3) to synthesize new pieces based on the timbre of separated sources. The model is inspired by the fact that when humans listen to music, our minds can not only separate the sounds of different instruments, but also at the same time perceive high-level representations such as score and timbre. To mirror such capability computationally, we designed a pitch-timbre disentanglement module based on a popular encoder-decoder neural architecture for source separation. The key inductive biases are vector-quantization for pitch representation and pitch-transformation invariant for timbre representation. In addition, we adopted a query-by-example method to achieve zero-shot learning, i.e., the model is capable of doing source separation, transcription, and synthesis for unseen instruments. The current design focuses on audio mixtures of two monophonic instruments. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing multi-task baselines, and the transcribed score serves as a powerful auxiliary for separation tasks.",

This problem is addressed as a pitch-informed classification task where each note is analysed individually. We also propose to utilise several kernel shapes in the convolutional layers in order to facilitate learning of timbre-discriminative feature maps. Experiments on the MusicNet dataset using 7 instrument classes show that our approach is able to achieve an average F-score of 0.904 when the original multi-pitch annotations are used as the pitch information for the system, and that it also excels if the note information is provided using third-party multi-pitch estimation algorithms. We also include ablation studies investigating the effects of the use of multiple kernel shapes and comparing different input representations for the audio and the note-related information.",

    "description": "Transformers have drawn attention in the MIR field for their remarkable performance shown in natural language processing and computer vision. However, prior works in the audio processing domain mostly use Transformer as a temporal feature aggregator that acts similar to RNNs. In this paper, we propose SpecTNT, a Transformer-based architecture to model both spectral and temporal sequences of an input time-frequency representation. Specifically, we introduce a novel variant of the Transformer-in-Transformer (TNT) architecture. In each SpecTNT block, a spectral Transformer extracts frequency-related features into the frequency class token (FCT) for each frame. Later, the FCTs are linearly projected and added to the temporal embeddings (TEs), which aggregate useful information from the FCTs. Then, a temporal Transformer processes the TEs to exchange information across the time axis. By stacking the SpecTNT blocks, we build the SpecTNT model to learn the representation for music signals. In experiments, SpecTNT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in music tagging and vocal melody extraction, and shows competitive performance for chord recognition. The effectiveness of SpecTNT and other design choices are further examined through ablation studies.",

    "description": "AugmentedNet is a new convolutional recurrent neural network for predicting Roman numeral labels. The network architecture is characterized by a separate convolutional block for bass and chromagram inputs. This layout is further enhanced by using synthetic training examples for data augmentation, and a greater number of tonal tasks to solve simultaneously via multitask learning. This paper reports the improved performance achieved by combining these ideas. The additional tonal tasks strengthen the shared representation learned through multitask learning. The synthetic examples, in turn, complement key transposition, which is often the only technique used for data augmentation in similar problems related to tonal music. The name \"AugmentedNet\" speaks to the increased number of both training examples and tonal tasks. We report on tests across six relevant and publicly available datasets: ABC, BPS, HaydnSun, TAVERN, When-in-Rome, and WTC. In our tests, our model outperforms recent methods of functional harmony, such as other convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based models. Finally, we show a new method for reconstructing the full Roman numeral label, based on common Roman numeral classes, which leads to better results compared to previous methods.",

Despite remarkable progress of lyrics-to-audio alignment systems in recent years, one thing remaining unresolved is whether the metrics employed to assess their performance are perceptually grounded. Even if a tolerance window for errors was fixed at 0.3s for the MIREX challenge, no experiment was conducted to confer psychological validity to this threshold. Following an interdisciplinary approach, fueled by psychology and musicology insights, we consider the lyrics-to-audio alignment evaluation from a user-centered perspective. In this paper, we call into question the perceptual robustness of the most used metric to evaluate this task. We investigate the perception of audio and lyrics synchrony through two realistic experimental settings inspired from karaoke, and discuss implications for evaluation metrics. The most striking features of these results are the asymmetrical perceptual thresholds of synchrony perception between lyrics and audio, as well as the influence of rhythmic factors on them.",

    "description": "While synthesizers have become commonplace in music production, many users find it difficult to control the parameters of a synthesizer to create the intended sound. In order to assist the user, the sound matching task aims to estimate synthesis parameters that produce a sound closest to the query sound. Recently, neural networks have been employed for this task. These neural networks are trained on paired data of synthesis parameters and the corresponding output sound, optimizing a loss of synthesis parameters. However, synthesis parameters are only indirectly correlated with the audio output. Another problem is that query made by the user usually consists of real-world sounds, different from the synthesizer output used during training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem of synthesizer sound matching by implementing a basic subtractive synthesizer using differentiable DSP modules. This synthesizer has interpretable controls and is similar to those used in music production. We can then train an estimator network by directly optimizing the spectral similarity of the synthesized output. Furthermore, we can train the network on real-world sounds whose ground-truth synthesis parameters are unavailable. We pre-train the network with parameter loss and fine-tune the model with spectral loss using real-world sounds. We show that the proposed method finds better matches compared to baseline models.",

Central to this analysis is the labeling of segments of a piece with chord symbols and local key information. In this work, we propose a modular system for performing such a harmonic analysis, incorporating spelled pitches (i.e., not treating enharmonically equivalent pitches as identical) and using a very large vocabulary of 1540 chords (each with a root, type, and inversion) and 70 keys (with a tonic and mode), leading to a full harmonic characterization similar to Roman numeral analysis. Our system's modular design allows each of its components to model an aspect of harmony at an appropriate level of granularity, and also aids in both flexibility and interpretability. We show that our system improves upon a state-of-the-art model for the task, both on a previously available corpus consisting mostly of pieces from the Classical and Romantic eras of Western music, as well as on a much larger corpus spanning a wider range from the 16th through the 20th centuries.",

    "description": "Deep learning approaches to automatic chord recognition and functional harmonic analysis of symbolic music have improved the state of the art, but they still face a common problem: how to deal with a vast chord vocabulary. The naive approach of writing one output class for each possible chord is hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the output size (~10 million classes). We can reduce this complexity by several orders of magnitude by treating each label (e.g. key or chord quality) independently. However this has been shown to lead to incoherent output labels. To solve this issue we introduce a modified Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) as the last layer of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network. The NADE layer ensures that labels related to the same chord are dependently predicted, therefore enforcing coherence. The experiments showcase the advantage of the new model both in automatic chord recognition and functional harmonic analysis compared to the model that does not include NADE as well as State of the Art models.",

We present a methodology for collecting a 2d beat distribution of period and phase from free beat-tapping data from multiple participants. The methodology allows capturing beat-tapping variability both within (e.g.: mid-track beat change) and between annotators (e.g.: participants tap at different phases). The data analysis methodology was tested with simulated beat tracks assessing robustness to tapping variability, mid-tapping beat change and disagreement between annotators. It was also tested on experimental tapping data where the entropy of the estimated beat distributions correlated with tapping difficulty reported by the participants. For the MIR task, we propose using optimal transport as an evaluation criterion for models that estimate the beat distribution from musical stimuli. This criterion provides better scores to beat estimations closer in phase or period to distributions obtained from data. Finally, we present baseline models for the task of estimating the beat distribution. The methodology is presented with aims to enhance the exploration of ambiguity in the beat percept. For example, it exposes if beat uncertainty is related to a pulse that is hard to produce or conflicting interpretations of the beat.",

Whereas such movements have been studied using a wide range of methods, only few studies have investigated synchronisation to real music stimuli in a cross-culturally comparative setting. The present study employs beat tracking evaluation metrics and accent histograms to analyze the differences in the ways participants from two cultural groups synchronize their tapping with either familiar or unfamiliar music stimuli. Instead of choosing two apparently remote cultural groups, we selected two groups of musicians that share cultural backgrounds, but that differ regarding the music style they specialize in. The employed method to record tapping responses in audio format facilitates a fine-grained analysis of metrical accents that emerge from the responses. The identified differences between groups are related to the metrical structures inherent to the two musical styles, such as non-isochronicity of the beat, and differences between the groups document the influence of the deep enculturation of participants to their style of expertise. Besides these findings, our study sheds light on a conceptual weakness of a common beat tracking evaluation metric, when applied to human tapping instead of machine generated beat estimations.",

However, making them operable with semantically meaningful controls remains an open challenge. An obvious approach is to control the GAN by conditioning it on metadata contained in audio datasets. Unfortunately, audio datasets often lack the desired annotations, especially in the musical domain. A way to circumvent this lack of annotations is to generate them, for example, with an automatic audio-tagging system. The output probabilities of such systems (so-called \"soft labels\") carry rich information about the characteristics of the respective audios and can be used to distill the knowledge from a teacher model into a student model. In this work, we perform knowledge distillation from a large audio tagging system into an adversarial audio synthesizer that we call DarkGAN. Results show that DarkGAN can synthesize musical audio with acceptable quality and exhibits moderate attribute control even with out-of-distribution input conditioning.

    "description": "This paper describes a phase-aware joint beat and downbeat estimation method mainly intended for popular music with a periodic metrical structure and steady tempo. The conventional approach to beat estimation is to train a deep neural network (DNN) that estimates the beat presence probability at each frame. This approach, however, relies heavily on a periodicity-aware post-processing step that detects beat times from the noisy probability sequence. To mitigate this problem, we have designed a DNN that estimates the beat phase at each frame whose period is equal to the beat interval. The estimation losses computed at all frames not limited to a fewer number of beat frames can thus be effectively used for backpropagation-based supervised training, whereas a DNN has conventionally been trained such that it constantly outputs zero at all non-beat frames. The same applies to downbeat estimation. We also modify the post-processing method for the estimated phase sequence. For joint beat and downbeat detection, we investigate multi-task learning architectures that output beat and downbeat phases in this order, in reverse order, and in parallel. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of phase modeling for stable beat and downbeat estimation.",

Recent attempts in this direction have relied on learning disentangled representations from data such that the underlying factors of variation are well separated. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between disentanglement and controllability by conducting a systematic study using different supervised disentanglement learning algorithms based on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture. Our experiments show that a high degree of disentanglement can be achieved by using different forms of supervision to train a strong discriminative encoder. However, in the absence of a strong generative decoder, disentanglement does not necessarily imply controllability. The structure of the latent space with respect to the VAE-decoder plays an important role in boosting the ability of a generative model to manipulate different attributes. To this end, we also propose methods and metrics to help evaluate the quality of a latent space with respect to the afforded degree of controllability.",

    "description": "Local explanation methods such as LIME have become popular in MIR as tools for generating post-hoc, model-agnostic explanations of a model's classification decisions. The basic idea is to identify a small set of human-understandable features of the classified example that are most influential on the classifier's prediction. These are then presented as an explanation. Evaluation of such explanations in publications often resorts to accepting what matches the expectation of a human without actually being able to verify if what the explanation shows is what really caused the model's prediction. This paper reports on targeted investigations where we try to get more insight into the actual veracity of LIME's explanations in an audio classification task. We deliberately design adversarial examples for the classifier, in a way that gives us knowledge about which parts of the input are potentially responsible for the model's (wrong) prediction. Asking LIME to explain the predictions for these adversaries permits us to study whether local explanations do indeed detect these regions of interest. We also look at whether LIME is more successful in finding perturbations that are more prominent and easily noticeable for a human. Our results suggest that LIME does not necessarily manage to identify the most relevant input features and hence it remains unclear whether explanations are useful or even misleading.",

This paper examines the relationships among audio features and the semantic timbre categories raspy/grainy/rough, harsh/noisy, and airy/breathy. Participants (n = 153) rated a random subset of 52 stimuli from a set of 156 ~2-second orchestral instrument sounds from varied instrument families, registers, and playing techniques. Stimuli were rated on the three semantic categories of interest and on perceived playing effort and emotional valence. With an updated version of the Timbre Toolbox (R-2021 A), we extracted 44 summary audio features from the stimuli using spectral and harmonic representations. These features were used as input for various models built to predict mean semantic ratings (raspy/grainy/rough, harsh/noisy, airy/breathy) for each sound. Random Forest models predicting semantic ratings from audio features outperformed Partial Least-Squares Regression models, consistent with previous results suggesting non-linear methods are advantageous in timbre semantic predictions using audio features. In comparing Relative Variable Importance measures from the models among the three semantic categories, results demonstrate that although these related semantic categories are associated in part with overlapping features, they can be differentiated through individual patterns of feature relationships.",

    "description": "Diversity is known to play an important role in recommender systems. However, its relationship to users and their satisfaction is not well understood, especially in the music domain. We present a user study: 92 participants were asked to evaluate personalized recommendation lists at varying levels of diversity. Recommendations were generated by two different collaborative filtering methods, and diversified in three different ways, one of which is a simple and novel method based on genre filtering. All diversified lists were recognised by users to be more diverse, and this diversification increased overall recommendation list satisfaction. Our simple filtering approach was also successful at tailoring diversity to some users. Within the collaborative filtering framework, however, we were not able to generate enough diversity to match all user preferences. Our results highlight the need to diversify in music recommendation lists, even when it comes at the cost of \"accuracy\".",

    "description": "Extended tonality is a central system that characterizes the music from the 19th up to the 21st century, including styles like popular music, film music or Jazz. Developing from classical major-minor tonality, the harmonic language of extended tonality forms its own set of rules and regularities, which are a result of the freer combinatoriality of chords within phrases, non-standard chord forms, the emancipation of dissonance, and the loosening of the concept of key. These phenomena posit a challenge for formal, mathematical theory building. The theoretical model proposed in this paper proceeds from Neo-Riemannian and Tonfeld theory, a systematic but informal music-theoretical framework for extended tonality. Our model brings together three fundamental components: the underlying algebraic structure of the Tonnetz, the three basic analytical categories from Tonfeld theory (octatonic and hexatonic collections as well as stacks of fifths), and harmonic syntax in terms of formal language theory. The proposed model is specified to a level of detail that lends itself for implementation and empirical investigation.",

    "description": "In this paper, we propose a novel score-base generative model for unconditional raw audio synthesis. Our proposal builds upon the latest developments on diffusion process modeling with stochastic differential equations, which already demonstrated promising results on image generation. We motivate novel heuristics for the choice of the diffusion processes better suited for audio generation, and consider the use of a conditional U-Net to approximate the score function. While previous approaches on diffusion models on audio were mainly designed as speech vocoders in medium resolution, our method termed CRASH (Controllable Raw Audio Synthesis with High-resolution) allows us to generate short percussive sounds in 44.1kHz in a controllable way. Through extensive experiments, we showcase on a drum sound generation task the numerous sampling schemes offered by our method (unconditional generation, deterministic generation, inpainting, interpolation, variations, class-conditional sampling) and propose the class-mixing sampling, a novel way to generate \"hybrid\" sounds. Our proposed method offers flexible generation capabilities with lighter and easier-to-train models than GAN-based methods.",

    "description": "A problem inherent to the task of large vocabulary automatic chord recognition (ACR) is that the distribution over the chord qualities typically exhibits power-law characteristics. This intrinsic imbalance makes it difficult for ACR systems to learn the rare chord qualities in a large chord vocabulary. While recent ACR systems have exploited the hierarchical relationships that exist between chord qualities, few have attempted to exploit these relationships explicitly to improve the classification of rare chord qualities. In this paper, we propose a convolutional Transformer model for the task of ACR trained on a dataset of 1217 tracks over a large chord vocabulary consisting of 170 chord types. In order to address the class imbalance of the chord quality distribution, we incorporate the hierarchical relationships between chord qualities into a curriculum learning training scheme that gradually learns the rare and complex chord qualities in the dataset. We show that the proposed convolutional Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional ACR evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we show that the proposed curriculum learning training scheme outperforms existing methods in improving the classification of rare chord qualities.",

    "description": "Music segmentation algorithms identify the structure of a music recording by automatically dividing it into sections and determining which sections repeat and when. Since the desired granularity of the sections may vary by application, multi-level segmentation produces several levels of segmentation ordered by granularity from one section (the whole song) up to N unique sections, and has proven to be a challenging MIR task. In this work we propose a multi-level segmentation method that leverages deep audio embeddings learned via other tasks. Our approach builds on an existing multi-level segmentation algorithm, replacing manually engineered features with deep embeddings learned through audio classification problems where data are abundant. Additionally, we propose a novel section fusion algorithm that leverages the multi-level segmentation to consolidate short segments at each level in a way that is consistent with the segmentations at lower levels. Through a series of experiments we show that replacing handcrafted features with deep embeddings can lead to significant improvements in multi-level music segmentation performance, and that section fusion further improves the results by cleaning up spurious short sections. We compare our approach to two strong baselines and show that it yields state-of-the-art results.",

In this work, we consider the task of learning music track representations by leveraging three rich heterogeneous sources of information: (i) organizational information (e.g., playlist co-occurrence), (ii) content information (e.g., audio & acoustics), and (iii) music stylistics (e.g., genre). We advocate for a multi-task formulation of graph representation learning, and propose MUSIG: Multi-task Sampling and Inductive learning on Graphs. MUSIG allows us to derive generalized track representations that combine the benefits offered by (i) the inductive graph based framework, which generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood, as well as, (ii) multi-task training of aggregation functions, which ensures the learnt functions perform well on a number of important tasks. We present large scale empirical results for track recommendation for the playlist completion task, and compare different classes of representation learning approaches, including collaborative filtering, word2vec and node embeddings as well as, graph embedding approaches. Our results demonstrate that considering content information (i.e.,audio and acoustic features) is useful and that multi-task supervision helps learn better representations.",

    "description": "The extent to which the sequence of tracks in music playlists matters to listeners is a disputed question, nevertheless a very important one for tasks such as music recommendation (e.g., automatic playlist generation or continuation). While several user studies already approached this question, results are largely inconsistent. In contrast, in this paper we take a data-driven approach and investigate 704,166 user-generated playlists of a major music streaming provider. In particular, we study the consistency (in terms of variance) of a variety of audio features and metadata between subsequent tracks in playlists, and we relate this variance to the corresponding variance computed on a position-independent set of tracks. Our results show that some features vary on average up to 16% less among subsequent tracks in comparison to position-independent pairs of tracks. Furthermore, we show that even pairs of tracks that lie up to 12 positions apart in the playlist are significantly more consistent in several audio features and genres. Our findings yield a better understanding of how users create playlists and will stimulate further progress in sequential music recommenders.",

    "description": "Intonation is the process of choosing an appropriate pitch for a given note in a musical performance. Particularly in polyphonic singing, where all musicians can continuously adapt their pitch, this leads to complex interactions. To achieve an overall balanced sound, the musicians dynamically adjust their intonation considering musical, perceptual, and acoustical aspects. When adapting the intonation in a recorded performance, a sound engineer may have to individually fine-tune the pitches of all voices to account for these aspects in a similar way. In this paper, we formulate intonation adaptation as a cost minimization problem. As our main contribution, we introduce a differentiable cost measure by adapting and combining existing principles for measuring intonation. In particular, our measure consists of two terms, representing a tonal aspect (the proximity to a tonal grid) and a harmonic aspect (the perceptual dissonance between salient frequencies). We show that, combining these two aspects, our measure can be used to flexibly account for different artistic intents while allowing for robust and joint processing of multiple voices in real-time. In an experiment, we demonstrate the potential of our approach for the task of intonation adaptation of amateur choral music using recordings from a publicly available multitrack dataset.",

Contrastive learning is a widely used technique in representation learning to learn a structured latent space capable of separately clustering multiple classes. It has been shown to produce state of the art results for image-based classification problems. We introduce a weighted contrastive loss suitable for regression tasks applied to a convolutional neural network and show that contrastive loss results in performance gains in regression tasks for MPA. Our results show that contrastive-based methods are able to match and exceed SoTA performance for MPA regression tasks by creating better class clusters within the latent space of the neural networks.",

Whilst offering great potential for discovery, such platform developments also pose the modern user with daily adoption decisions on two fronts: platform affordance adoption and the adoption of recommendations therein. Following a carefully constrained set of Deezer users over a 2-year observation period, our work explores factors driving user behaviour in the broad sense, by differentiating users on the basis of their temporal daily usage, adoption of the main platform affordances, and the ways in which they react to them, especially in terms of recommendation adoption. Diverging from a perspective common in studies on the effects of recommendation, we assume and confirm that users exhibit very diverse behaviours in using and adopting the platform affordances. The resulting complex and quite heteregeneous picture demonstrates that there is no blanket answer for adoption practices of both recommendation features and recommendations.",

    "description": "Performers' distortion of notated rhythms in a musical score is a significant factor in the production of convincingly expressive music interpretations. Sometimes exaggerated, and sometimes subtle, these distortions are driven by a variety of factors, including schematic features (both structural such as phrase boundaries and surface events such as recurrent rhythmic patterns), as well as relatively rare veridical events that characterize the individuality and uniqueness of a particular piece. Performers tend to adopt similar pervasive approaches to interpreting schemas, resulting in common performance practices, while often formulating less common approaches to the interpretation of veridical events. Furthermore, some performers choose anomalous interpretations of schemas. We present a machine learning model of expressive performance of Chopin Mazurkas and a critical analysis of the output based upon statistical analyses of the musical scores and of recorded performances. We compare the timings of recorded human performances of selected Mazurkas by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin with performances of the same works generated by a neural network trained with recorded human performances of the entire corpus. This paper demonstrates that while machine learning succeeds, to some degree, in expressive interpretation of schemata, convincingly capturing performance characteristics remains very much a work in progress.",

For this task, to ensure the relevance of generated samples and training music, we present a novel pitch-group representation. SinTra, consisting of a pyramid of Transformer-XL with a multi-scale training strategy, can learn both the musical structure and the relative positional relationship between notes of the single training music segment. Additionally, for maintaining the inter-track correlation, we use the convolution operation to process multi-track music, and when decoding, the tracks are independent to each other to prevent interference. We evaluate SinTra with both subjective study and objective metrics. The comparison results show that our framework can learn information from a single music segment more sufficiently than Music Transformer. Also the comparison between SinTra and its variant, i.e., the single-stage SinTra with the first stage only, shows that the pyramid structure can effectively suppress overly-fragmented notes.",

In this work, we introduce SimCLR to the music domain and contribute a large chain of audio data augmentations to form a simple framework for self-supervised, contrastive learning of musical representations: CLMR. This approach works on raw time-domain music data and requires no labels to learn useful representations. We evaluate CLMR in the downstream task of music classification on the MagnaTagATune and Million Song datasets and present an ablation study to test which of our music-related innovations over SimCLR are most effective. A linear classifier trained on the proposed representations achieves a higher average precision than supervised models on the MagnaTagATune dataset, and performs comparably on the Million Song dataset. Moreover, we show that CLMR's representations are transferable using out-of-domain datasets, indicating that our method has strong generalisability in music classification. Lastly, we show that the proposed method allows data-efficient learning on smaller labeled datasets: we achieve an average precision of 33.1% despite using only 259 labeled songs in the MagnaTagATune dataset (1% of the full dataset) during linear evaluation. To foster reproducibility and future research on self-supervised learning in music, we publicly release the pre-trained models and the source code of all experiments of this paper.",

Thus, in this work we explore the incorporation of language models into a Seq2Seq-based architecture to try to improve transcriptions where the aforementioned unclear writing produces statistically unsound mistakes, which as far as we know, has never been attempted for this field of research on this architecture. After studying various Language Model integration techniques, the experimental evaluation on historical handwritten music scores shows a significant improvement over the state of the art, showing that this is a promising research direction for dealing with such difficult manuscripts.",

To this end, we take a supervised metric learning approach: we train a deep neural network to output embeddings that are near each other for two spectrogram inputs if both have the same section type (according to an annotation), and otherwise far apart. We propose a batch sampling scheme to ensure the labels in a training pair are interpreted meaningfully. The trained model extracts features that can be used by existing MSA algorithms.

However, most models are only applicable to short-term music, while learning long-term music representations remains a challenging task. We have seen several studies attempting to learn hierarchical representations directly in an end-to-end manner, but these models have not been able to achieve the desired results and the training process is not stable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn long-term symbolic music representations through contextual constraints. First, we use contrastive learning to pre-train a long-term representation by constraining its difference from the short-term representation (extracted by an off-the-shelf model). Then, we fine-tune the long-term representation by a hierarchical prediction model such that a good long-term representation (e.g., an 8-bar representation) can reconstruct the corresponding short-term ones (e.g., the 2-bar representations within the 8-bar range). Experiments show that our method stabilizes the training and the fine-tuning steps. In addition, the designed contextual constraints benefit both reconstruction and disentanglement, significantly outperforming the baselines.",

Traditional chroma features relying on signal processing are often influenced by timbral properties such as overtones or vibrato and, thus, only roughly correspond to the pitch classes indicated by a score. Deep learning provides a promising possibility to overcome such problems but requires large annotated datasets. Previous approaches therefore use either synthetic audio, MIDI-piano recordings, or chord annotations for training. Since these strategies have different limitations, we propose to learn transcription-like pitch-class representations using pre-synchronized score-audio pairs of classical music. We train several CNNs with musically inspired architectures and evaluate their pitch-class estimates for various instrumentations including orchestra, piano, chamber music, and singing. Moreover, we illustrate the learned features' behavior when used as input to a chord recognition system. In all our experiments, we compare cross-validation with cross-dataset evaluation.

    "description": "Despite the success of end-to-end approaches, chroma (or pitch-class) features remain a useful mid-level representation of music audio recordings due to their direct interpretability. Since traditional chroma variants obtained with signal processing suffer from timbral artifacts such as overtones or vibrato, they do not directly reflect the pitch classes notated in the score. For this reason, training a chroma representation using deep learning (\"deep chroma\") has become an interesting strategy. Existing approaches involve the use of supervised learning with strongly aligned labels for which, however, only few datasets are available. Recently, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, initially proposed for speech, has been adopted to learn monophonic (single-label) pitch-class features using weakly aligned labels based on corresponding score--audio segment pairs. To exploit this strategy for the polyphonic case, we propose the use of a multi-label variant of this CTC loss, the MCTC, and formalize this loss for the pitch-class scenario. Our experiments demonstrate that the weakly aligned approach achieves almost equivalent pitch-class estimates than training with strongly aligned annotations. We then study the sensitivity of our approach to segment duration and mismatch. Finally, we compare the learned features with other pitch-class representations and demonstrate their use for chord and local key recognition on classical music datasets.",

Protection mechanisms in digital audio processing tools have not eliminated the need of production entities located downstream the distribution chain to assess audio quality and detect defects inserted further upstream. Such analysis often relies on the received audio and scarce meta-data alone. Deliberate use of artefacts such as clicks in popular music as well as more recent defects stemming from corruption in modern audio encodings call for data-centric and context-sensitive solutions for detection. We present a convolutional network architecture following end-to-end encoder-decoder configuration to develop detectors for two exemplary audio defects. A click detector is trained and compared to a traditional signal processing method, with a discussion on context sensitivity. Additional post-processing is used for data augmentation and workflow simulation.

The proposed model captures local acoustic characteristics in shallow convolutional layers, then temporally summarizes the sequence of the extracted features using stacked self-attention layers. Through a careful model assessment, we first show that the proposed architecture outperforms the previous state-of-the-art music tagging models that are based on convolutional neural networks under a supervised scheme. The Music Tagging Transformer is further improved by noisy student training, a semi-supervised approach that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data combined with data augmentation. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize the entire audio of the million song dataset.",

    "description": "Content creators often use music to enhance their stories, as it can be a powerful tool to convey emotion. In this paper, our goal is to help creators find music to match the emotion of their story. We focus on text-based stories that can be auralized (e.g., books), use multiple sentences as input queries, and automatically retrieve matching music. We formalize this task as a cross-modal text-to-music retrieval problem. Both the music and text domains have existing datasets with emotion labels, but mismatched emotion vocabularies prevent us from using mood or emotion annotations directly for matching. To address this challenge, we propose and investigate several emotion embedding spaces, both manually defined (e.g., valence/arousal) and data-driven (e.g., Word2Vec and metric learning) to bridge this gap. Our experiments show that by leveraging these embedding spaces, we are able to successfully bridge the gap between modalities to facilitate cross modal retrieval. We show that our method can leverage the well established valence-arousal space, but that it can also achieve our goal via data-driven embedding spaces. By leveraging data-driven embeddings, our approach has the potential of being generalized to other retrieval tasks that require broader or completely different vocabularies.",

    "description": "When writing pop or hip-hop music, musicians sometimes sample from other songs and fuse the samples into their own music. We propose a new task in the symbolic music domain that is similar to the music sampling practice and a neural network model named CollageNet to fulfill this task. Specifically, given a piece of melody and an irrelevant accompaniment with the same length, we fuse them into harmonic two-track music after some necessary changes to the inputs. Besides, users are involved in the fusion process by providing controls to the amount of changes along several disentangled musical aspects: rhythm and pitch of the melody, and chord and texture of the accompaniment. We conduct objective and subjective experiments to demonstrate the validity of our model. Experimental results confirm that our model achieves significantly higher level of harmony than rule-based and data-driven baseline methods. Furthermore, the musicality of each of the tracks does not deteriorate after the transformation applied by CollageNet, which is also superior to the two baselines.",

    "description": "In music information retrieval (MIR), beat-tracking is one of the most fundamental and important task. However, a perfect algorithm is difficult to achieve. In addition, there could be a no unique correct answer because what one interprets as a beat differs for each individual. To address this, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop user interface that allows the system to interactively adapt to a specific user and target music. In our system, the user does not need to correct all errors manually, but rather only a small portion of the errors. The system then adapts the internal neural network model to the target, and automatically corrects remaining errors. This is achieved by a novel adaptive runtime self-attention in which the adaptable parameters are intimately integrated as a part of the user interface. It enables both low-cost training using only a local context of the music piece, and by contrast, highly effective runtime adaptation using the global context. We show our framework dramatically reduces the user's effort of correcting beat tracking errors in our experiments.",

Second, we describe a way to modify previous models in order to enable cross-model transfer learning, in which a model trained entirely on sheet music can be used to perform composer classification of audio or MIDI data. Third, we explore the performance of trained models in a 1-shot learning context, in which the model performs classification among a set of composers that are unseen in training.

We focus on the main technical challenge of aligning the individual part recordings against a reference ``full mix'' recording containing a performance of the work. We propose an iterative subtractive alignment approach, in which each part recording is aligned against the full mix recording and then subtracted from it. We also explore different feature representations and cost metrics to handle the asymmetrical nature of the part--full mix comparison. We evaluate our proposed approach on two different datasets: one that is a modification of the URMP dataset that presents an idealized setting, and another that contains a small set of piano trio data collected from musicians during the pandemic specifically for this study. Compared to a standard pairwise alignment approach, we find that the proposed approach has strong performance on the URMP dataset and mixed success on the more realistic piano trio data.",

The problem is that the available public datasets are limited either in size or in realism, and are thus suboptimal for training purposes. Indeed, the best results are currently obtained via a rather convoluted multi-step training process that involves both real and synthetic datasets. To address this issue, starting from the observation that the communities of rhythm games players provide a large amount of annotated data, we curated a new dataset of crowdsourced drum transcriptions. This dataset contains real-world music, is manually annotated, and is about two orders of magnitude larger than any other non-synthetic dataset, making it a prime candidate for training purposes. However, due to crowdsourcing, the initial annotations contain mistakes. We discuss how the quality of the dataset can be improved by automatically correcting different types of mistakes. When used to train a popular DTM model, the dataset yields a performance that matches that of the state-of-the-art for DTM, thus demonstrating the quality of the annotations.",

To address this problem, we propose AccoMontage, an accompaniment arrangement system for whole pieces of music through unifying phrase selection and neural style transfer. We focus on generating piano accompaniments for folk/pop songs based on a lead sheet (i.e., melody with chord progression). Specifically, AccoMontage first retrieves phrase montages from a database while recombining them structurally using dynamic programming. Second, chords of the retrieved phrases are manipulated to match the lead sheet via style transfer. Lastly, the system offers controls over the generation process. In contrast to pure learning-based approaches, AccoMontage introduces a novel hybrid pathway, in which rule-based optimization and deep learning are both leveraged to complement each other for high-quality generation.

While such a framework is prevalent in the scenario of sequence labeling tasks and yields promising results in beat and downbeat estimations, it also indicates a shortage of the employed neural networks, given that the post-processing usually provides a notable performance gain over the previous stage. Moreover, the assumption often made for the post-processing is not suitable for many musical pieces. In this work, we attempt to improve the performance of joint beat and downbeat estimation without incorporating the post-processing stage.

However, progress is currently limited by the difficulty of obtaining such note labels for natural audio recordings at scale. In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that for monophonic music, the transcription problem is much easier and largely solved via modern pitch-tracking methods. Specifically, we show that we are able to combine recordings of real monophonic music (and their transcriptions) into artificial and musically-incoherent mixtures, greatly increasing the scale of labeled training data. By pretraining on these mixtures, we can use a larger neural network model and significantly improve upon the state of the art in multi-instrument polyphonic transcription. We demonstrate this improvement across a variety of datasets and in a ``zero-shot'' setting where the model has not been trained on any data from the evaluation domain.",

Using these fingerprints, the method performs a comprehensive search to identify the query audio and precisely estimate its timestamp in the reference audio. Our framework involves training a CNN to maximize the similarity between pairs of embeddings extracted from clean audio and its corresponding distorted and time-shifted version. We employ a channel-wise spectral-temporal attention mechanism to capture salient time indices and spectral bands in the CNN features. The attention mechanism enables the CNN to better discriminate the audio by giving more weight to the salient spectral-temporal patches in the signal. Experimental results indicate that our system is efficient in computation and memory usage while being more accurate, particularly at higher distortion levels, than competing state-of-the-art systems and scalable to a larger database.",

    "description": "Self-supervised learning has steadily been gaining traction in recent years. In music information retrieval (MIR), one promising recent application of self-supervised learning is the CLMR framework (contrastive learning of musical representations). CLMR has shown good performance, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art end-to-end classification models, but it is strictly an encoding framework. It suffers the characteristic limitation of any encoder that it cannot explicitly combine multi-timescale information, whereas a characteristic feature of human audio perception is that we tend to perceive all frequencies simultaneously. To this end, we propose a generalization of CLMR that learns to extract and explicitly combine representations across different frequency resolutions, which we coin the tailed U-Net (TUNe). TUNe architectures combine multi-timescale information during a decoding phase, similar to U-Net architectures used in computer vision and source separation, but have a tail added to reduce sample-level information to a smaller pre-defined number of representation dimensions. The size of the decoding phase is a hyperparameter, and in the case of a zero-layer decoding phase, TUNe reduces to CLMR. The best TUNe architectures, however, require less training time to match CLMR performance, have superior transfer learning performance, and are competitive with state-of-the-art models even at dramatically reduced dimensionalities.",

As this approach enforces phase continuity, SawSing can generate singing voices without the phase-discontinuity glitch of many existing vocoders. Moreover, the source-filter assumption provides an inductive bias that allows SawSing to be trained on a small amount of data. Our evaluation shows that SawSing converges much faster and outperforms state-of-the-art generative adversarial network- and diffusion-based vocoders in a resource-limited scenario with only 3 training recordings and a 3-hour training time.",

    "description": "Self-supervised methods have emerged as a promising avenue for representation learning in the recent years since they alleviate the need for labeled datasets, which are scarce and expensive to acquire. Contrastive methods are a popular choice for self-supervision in the audio domain, and typically provide a learning signal by forcing the model to be invariant to some transformations of the input. These methods, however, require measures such as negative sampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from collapsing on trivial solutions. In this work, instead of invariance, we propose to use equivariance as a self-supervision signal to learn audio tempo representations from unlabelled data. We derive a simple loss function that prevents the network from collapsing on a trivial solution during training, without requiring any form of regularisation or negative sampling.Our experiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for tempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving performance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks. As an added benefit, our method only requires moderate compute resources and therefore remains accessible to a wide research community.",

    "description": "Popularized by Arnold Schoenberg in the mid-20th century, the method of twelve-tone composition produces musical compositions based on one or more orderings of the equal-tempered chromatic scale. The work of twelve-tone composers is famously challenging to traditional Western tonal and structural sensibilities; even so, group theoretic approaches have determined that 10% of certain composers' works contain a highly unusual classical symmetry of music. We extend this result by revealing many symmetries that were previously undetected in the works of Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. Our approach is computational rather than group theoretic, scanning each composition for symmetries of many different cardinalities. Thus, we capture partial symmetries that would be overlooked by more formal means. Moreover, our methods are applicable beyond the narrow scope of twelve-tone composition. We achieve our results by first extending the group-theoretic notion of symmetry to encompass shorter motives that may be repeated and reprised in a given composition, and then comparing the incidence of these symmetries between the work of composers and the space of all possible 12-tone rows. We present four candidate hierarchies of symmetry and show that in each model, between 75% and 95% of actual compositions contained high levels of internal symmetry.",

Therefore, the primary motivation of this work is to explore the potential of Bayesian nonparametric models in comparison to DL models for music representation learning.

We added PHRASE and a new event, BAR COUNTDOWN, which indicates the number of bars remaining in the phrase, to the existing event-based music representations. To reflect user input indicating the phrase lengths of the piece being generated, we used an autoregressive generation model that adds these two events to the generated event-token sequence based on the user input and uses it as input for the next time step.

Among the attempts to ameliorate the training process of GANs, the idea of Projected GAN emerges as an effective solution for GAN-based image generation, establishing the state-of-the-art in different image applications. The core idea is to use a pre-trained classifier to constrain the feature space of the discriminator to stabilize and improve GAN training. This paper investigates whether Projected GAN can similarly improve audio generation, by evaluating the performance of a StyleGAN2-based audio-domain loop generation model with and without using a pre-trained feature space in the discriminator. Moreover, we compare the performance of using a general versus domain-specific classifier as the pre-trained audio classifier. With experiments on both drum loop and synth loop generation, we show that a general audio classifier works better, and that with Projected GAN our loop generation models can converge around 5 times faster without performance degradation.",

A computational model of how lyrics are set as melodies is important for automatic composition systems, but an end-to-end lyric-to-melody model would require enormous amounts of paired training data.

    "description": "Various features \u2013 from low-level acoustics, to higher-level statistical regularities, to memory associations \u2013 contribute to the experience of musical enjoyment and pleasure. Recent work suggests that musical surprisal, that is, the unexpectedness of a musical event given its context, may directly predict listeners' experiences of pleasure and enjoyment during music listening. Understanding how surprisal shapes listeners' preferences for certain musical pieces has implications for music recommender systems, which are typically content- (both acoustic or semantic) or metadata-based. Here we test a recently developed computational algorithm, called Dynamic-Regularity Extraction (D-REX), that uses Bayesian inference to predict the surprisal that humans experience while listening to music. We demonstrate that the brain tracks musical surprisal as modeled by D-REX by conducting a decoding analysis on the neural signal (collected through magnetoencephalography) of participants listening to music. Thus, we demonstrate the validity of a computational model of musical surprisal, which may remarkably inform the next generation of recommender systems. In addition, we present an open-source neural dataset which will be available for future research to foster approaches combining MIR with cognitive neuroscience, an approach we believe will be a key strategy in characterizing people's reactions to music.",

    "description": "We propose Beat Transformer, a novel Transformer encoder architecture for joint beat and downbeat tracking. Different from previous models that track beats solely based on the spectrogram of an audio mixture, our model deals with demixed spectrograms with multiple instrument channels. This is inspired by the fact that humans perceive metrical structures from richer musical contexts, such as chord progression and instrumentation. To this end, we develop a Transformer model with both time-wise attention and instrument-wise attention to capture deep-buried metrical cues. Moreover, our model adopts a novel dilated self-attention mechanism, which achieves powerful hierarchical modelling with only linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in demixed beat tracking over the non-demixed version. Also, Beat Transformer achieves up to 4% point improvement in downbeat tracking accuracy over the TCN architectures. We further discover an interpretable attention pattern that mirrors our understanding of hierarchical metrical structures.",

It is necessary to actively control musical expression for creating a new music performance that conveys various emotions or nuances. However, previous approaches were limited to following the composer's guidelines of musical expression or dealing with only a part of the musical attributes. We aim to disentangle the entire musical expression and structural attribute of piano performance using a conditional VAE framework. It stochastically generates expressive parameters from latent representations and given note structures. In addition, we employ self-supervised approaches that force the latent variables to represent target attributes. Finally, we leverage a two-step encoder and decoder that learn hierarchical dependency to enhance the naturalness of the output. Experimental results show that our system can stably generate performance parameters relevant to the given musical scores, learn disentangled representations, and control musical attributes independently of each other.",

    "description": "As music has become more available especially on music streaming platforms, people have started to have distinct preferences to fit to their varying listening situations, also known as context. Hence, there has been a growing interest in considering the user's situation when recommending music to users. Previous works have proposed personalized auto-taggers to infer situation-related tags from music content and user's global listening preferences. However, in a practical music retrieval system, these context-aware auto-tagger could be only used by assuming that the context class is explicitly provided by the user. In this work, for designing a fully automatised music retrieval system, we propose to disambiguate the user's listening information from stream data. Namely, we propose a system which can generate a situational playlist for a user at a certain time first by leveraging personalized music auto-taggers, and second by automatically inferring the user's situation from stream data (e.g. device, network) and user's general profile information (e.g. age). Experiments show that such a personalized context-aware music retrieval system is feasible, but the performance suffers in the case of new users, new tracks or when the number of context classes increases.",

Specifically, using paired data of drumless tracks and the corresponding human-made drum tracks, we train a Transformer model to improvise the drum part of an unseen drumless recording. We combine two approaches to encode the input audio. First, we train a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to represent the input audio with discrete codes, which can then be readily used in a Transformer. Second, using an audio- domain beat tracking model, we compute beat-related features of the input audio and use them as embeddings in the Transformer. Instead of generating the drum track directly as waveforms, we use a separate VQ-VAE to encode the mel-spectrogram of a drum track into another set of discrete codes, and train the Transformer to predict the sequence of drum-related discrete codes. The output codes are then converted to a mel-spectrogram with a decoder, and then to the waveform with a vocoder. We report both objective and subjective evaluations of variants of the proposed model, demonstrating that the model with beat information generates drum accompaniment that is rhythmically and stylistically consistent with the input audio.",

Given a symbolic music score, our model takes in an arbitrary number of voices in a beat-quantized form, and predicts a 4-level hierarchical metrical structure from downbeat-level to section-level. We also annotate a dataset using RWC-POP MIDI files to facilitate training and evaluation. We show by experiments that the proposed method performs better than the rule-based approach under different orchestration settings.

In this paper, we propose novel harmonic audio features based on the perceptually-inspired tonal interval vector space, computed as the Fourier transform of chroma vectors. Our contribution includes mid-level features for musical dissonance, chromaticity, dyadicity, triadicity, diminished quality, diatonicity, and whole-toneness. Moreover, we quantify the perceptual relationship between short- and long-term harmonic structures, tonal dispersion, harmonic changes, and complexity. Beyond the computation on fixed-size windows, we propose a context-sensitive harmonic segmentation approach. We assess the robustness of the new harmonic features in style classification tasks regarding classical music periods and composers. Our results align with, slightly outperforming, existing features and suggest that other musical properties than those in state-of-the-art literature are partially captured. We discuss the features regarding their musical interpretation and compare the different feature groups regarding their effectiveness for discriminating classical music periods and composers.",

This model requires only the annotations of full score pages, which greatly alleviates the task of manual labeling.

    "description": "Vocoders are models capable of transforming a low-dimensional spectral representation of an audio signal, typically the mel spectrogram, to a waveform. Modern speech generation pipelines use a vocoder as their final component. Recent vocoder models developed for speech achieve high degree of realism, such that it is natural to wonder how they would perform on music signals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical sound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific artifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when applied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing sustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due to the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a time-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as a convolutional neural network. We propose a new vocoder model that is specifically designed for music. Key to improving the pitch stability is the choice of a shift-invariant target space that consists of the magnitude spectrum and the phase gradient. We discuss the reasons that inspired us to re-formulate the vocoder task, outline a working example, and evaluate it on musical signals. Our method results in 60% and 10% improved reconstruction of sustained notes and chords with respect to existing models, using a novel harmonic error metric.",

This module generates structured and coherent full-length chord progression by optimizing and balancing three loss terms: a micro-level loss for note-wise dissonance, a meso-level loss for phrase-template matching, and a macro-level loss for full piece coherency. Second, we develop a graphical user interface which allows users to select different styles of chord progression and piano texture. Currently, chord progression styles include Pop, R&B, and Dark, while piano texture styles include several levels of voicing density and rhythmic complexity. Experimental results show that both our harmonization and arrangement results significantly outperform the baselines.

Specifically, we explore how the domain of pre-training datasets (music or generic audio) and the pre-training methodology (supervised or unsupervised) affects the adequacy of the resulting audio embeddings for downstream tasks.We show that models trained via supervised learning on large-scale expert-annotated music datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of music labelling tasks, each with novel content and vocabularies. This can be done in an efficient manner with models containing less than 100 million parameters that require no fine-tuning or reparameterization for downstream tasks, making this approach practical for industry-scale audio catalogs.Within the class of unsupervised learning strategies, we show that the domain of the training dataset can significantly impact the performance of representations learned by the model. We find that restricting the domain of the pre-training dataset to music allows for training with smaller batch sizes while achieving state-of-the-art in unsupervised learning---and in some cases, supervised learning---for music understanding.We also corroborate that, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on many tasks, supervised learning can cause models to specialize to the supervised information provided, somewhat compromising a model's generality.",

With recent advancements in Deep Learning and powerful models such as Transformers, there has been huge progress in automatic music generation. In an accompaniment generation context, creating a coherent drum pattern with apposite fills and improvisations at proper locations in a song is a challenging task even for an experienced drummer. Drum beats tend to follow a repetitive pattern through stanzas with fills/improvisation at section boundaries. In this work, we tackle the task of drum pattern generation conditioned on the accompanying music played by four melodic instruments \u2013 Piano, Guitar, Bass and Strings. We use the transformer sequence to sequence model to generate a basic drum pattern conditioned on the melodic accompaniment to find that improvisation is largely absent, attributed possibly to its relatively low representation in the training data. We propose a novelty function that represents the extent of improvisation in a specific bar relative to its neighbors. We train a model to detect improvisation positions from the melodic accompaniment tracks. Finally, we use a novel BERT inspired in-filling architecture, to learn the structure of both the drums and melody to in-fill elements of improvised music.",

The absence of a unified vision makes it difficult to pinpoint its state-of-the-art and determine directions for improvement. To get past this bottleneck, it is necessary to consolidate datasets and evaluation methodologies to allow comprehensive benchmarking. In our review of prior work, we demonstrate the extent of variation in problem scope, datasets, and evaluation practices across audio to score alignment research. To circumvent the high cost of creating large-scale datasets with various instruments, styles, performance conditions, and musician proficiency from scratch, the research community could generate ground truth approximations from non-audio to score alignment datasets which include a temporal mapping between a music score and its corresponding audio. We show a methodology for adapting the Aligned Scores and Performances dataset, created originally for beat tracking and music transcription. We filter the dataset semi- automatically by applying a set of Dynamic Time Warping based Audio to Score Alignment methods using out-of-the-box Chroma and Constant-Q Transform extraction algorithms, suitable for the characteristics of the piano performances of the dataset. We use the results to discuss the limitations of the generated ground truths and data adaptation method.

We then compared the country-of-origin of the artists, arousal music features, and socioeconomic indicators. Songs from artists with Anglo-American backgrounds tended to have higher eigencentrality overall, and mixed effects regressions showed that eigencentrality was negatively associated with danceability, and positively associated with spectral energy, and the migrant population of the country (of the charts). Next, using community detection, we observed 11 separate 'communities' in the network. Most communities appeared to be limited by region/culture, but Anglo-American music seemed disproportionally able to transcend cultural boundaries far beyond their geographical borders.

Through these methods, we aim at highlighting the differences of the corpora in order to obtain an outline of the evolution of the subgenre.

However, most of the existing works for IPT detection show low efficiency for variable-length audio and provide no assurance in the generalization as they rely on a single sound bank for training and testing. In this study, we propose an end-to-end Guzheng playing technique detection system using Fully Convolutional Networks that can be applied to variable-length audio. Because each Guzheng playing technique is applied to a note, a dedicated onset detector is trained to divide an audio into several notes and its predictions are fused with frame-wise IPT predictions. During fusion, we add the IPT predictions frame by frame inside each note and get the IPT with the highest probability within each note as the final output of that note. We create a new dataset named GZ_IsoTech from multiple sound banks and real-world recordings for Guzheng performance analysis. Our approach achieves 87.97% in frame-level accuracy and 80.76% in note-level F1-score, outperforming existing works by a large margin, which indicates the effectiveness of our proposed method in IPT detection.",

    "description": "The existing MIR research on genre classification primarily focuses on how to classify a song into the \"correct\" genre while downplaying the fact that genres mutate over time and in response to social change in terms of their musical properties. Songs claiming the same genre can sound very different if they are released years apart, and genres may revive musical traditions from the past. In this paper, I show that the performance of genre classifiers fluctuates as genres evolve. Unsatisfactory performance of the classifiers may not indicate algorithmic flaws but rather the change of genre characteristics. I demonstrate this by studying the case of Chinese Hip-Hop music. Specifically, I collected and analyzed 69,427 songs from four genres (Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, and Folk) released on a Chinese music platform between 2009 and 2019. Using classifiers trained from the songs in different year cohorts to predict the genre of all the songs, I show how genre classifiers can be used to detect the stylistic shift in Hip-Hop that happened during this period. The paper thus offers a novel, sociological perspective on contending with the much-challenged idea of improving genre classification accuracy for its own sake. However, instead of questioning the effort, I argue that MIR research on genre classification can be helpful for studying genre as a social construct and cultural phenomenon if the pursuit of prediction performance and the cultural meaning of inaccurate prediction are carefully balanced.",

    "description": "Computational Musicology and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) address the core musical question under study from a different perspective, often a combination of top-down vs. bottom-up approaches. However, the evaluation metrics for MIR tend to capture the model accuracy in terms of the goal. For instance, mode (melodic framework) recognition is implemented with a goal to evaluate and compare melodic analysis approaches, but it is worth investigating if at all it lends itself as one befitting proxy task. In this work, we aim to review whether the model actually learns the task it is intended for. This is particularly relevant in non-Eurogenetic music repertoires where the grammatical rules are rather prescriptive. We employ methodologies that combine domain-knowledge and data-driven optimizations as a possible way for a comprehensive understanding of these relationships. This is tested on Makam which is one of the understudied corpora in MIR. We evaluate an array of feature-engineering methods on the largest mode recognition dataset curated for Ottoman-Turkish makam music, composed of 1000 recordings in 50 makams. We adapted the time-delayed melody surfaces (TDMS) feature, which in combination with support vector machine (SVM) classifier yields 77.2% recognition accuracy, comparable to the current state-of-the-art. We also address (ethno)musicology-driven tasks with a view to gathering deeper insights into this music, such as tuning, intonation, and melodic similarity. We aim to propose avenues to extend the study to makam characterization over the mere goal of recognizing the mode, to better understand the (dis)similarity space and other plausible musically interesting facets.",

This paper presents a dataset for Greek Traditional and Folk music that includes 1570 pieces, summing in around 80 hours of data. The dataset incorporates YouTube timestamped links for retrieving audio and video, along with rich metadata information with regards to instrumentation, geography and genre, among others. The content has been collected from a Greek documentary series that is available online, where academics present music traditions of Greece with live music and dance performance during the show, along with discussions about social, cultural and musicological aspects of the presented music. Therefore, this procedure has resulted in a significant wealth of descriptions regarding a variety of aspects, such as musical genre, places of origin and musical instruments. In addition, the audio recordings were performed under strict production-level specifications, in terms of recording equipment, leading to very clean and homogeneous audio content. In this work, apart from presenting the dataset in detail, we propose a baseline deep-learning classification approach to recognize the involved musicological attributes. The dataset, the baseline classification methods and the models are provided in public repositories. Future directions for further refining the dataset are also discussed.",

We investigate how singers use singing techniques using real-world recordings of famous solo singers in Japanese popular music songs (J-POP). First, we built a new dataset of singing techniques. The dataset consists of 168 commercial J-POP songs, and each song is annotated using various singing techniques with timestamps and vocal pitch contours. We also present descriptive statistics of singing techniques on the dataset to clarify what and how often singing techniques appear. We further explored the difficulty of the automatic detection of singing techniques using previously proposed machine learning techniques.

The automation of music production tasks has become an emerging field in recent years, where rule-based methods and machine learning approaches have been explored. Nevertheless, the lack of dry or clean instrument recordings limits the performance of such models, which is still far from professional human-made mixes. We explore whether we can use out-of-domain data such as wet or processed multitrack music recordings and repurpose it to train supervised deep learning models that can bridge the current gap in automatic mixing quality. To achieve this we propose a novel data preprocessing method that allows the models to perform automatic music mixing. We also redesigned a listening test method for evaluating music mixing systems.

In computer vision, concept learning was therein proposed to adjust explanations to the right abstraction level (e.g. detect clinical concepts from radiographs). These methods have yet to be used for MIR.In this paper, we adapt concept learning to the realm of music, with its particularities. For instance, music concepts are typically non-independent and of mixed nature (e.g. genre, instruments, mood), unlike previous work that assumed disentangled concepts.We propose a method to learn numerous music concepts from audio and then automatically hierarchise them to expose their mutual relationships. We conduct experiments on datasets of playlists from a music streaming service, serving as a few annotated examples for diverse concepts.

ALT has not been well developed mainly due to the dearth of the paired singing voice and lyrics datasets for model training. Considering that there is a large amount of ASR training data, a straightforward method is to leverage ASR data to enhance ALT training. However, the improvement is marginal when training the ALT system directly with ASR data, because of the gap between the singing voice and standard speech data which is rooted in music-specific acoustic characteristics in singing voice. In this paper, we propose PDAugment, a data augmentation method that adjusts pitch and duration of speech at syllable level under the guidance of music scores to help ALT training. Specifically, we adjust the pitch and duration of each syllable in natural speech to those of the corresponding note extracted from music scores, to narrow the gap between natural speech and singing voice. Experiments on DSing30 and Dali corpus show that the ALT system equipped with our PDAugment outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems by 5.9% and 18.1% WERs respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of PDAugment for ALT.",

However, the sensitivity of these metrics to variations in the statistical parameters that define an audio texture is not well studied. In this work, we provide a systematic study of the sensitivity of some of the existing audio quality evaluation metrics to parameter variations in audio textures. Furthermore, we also study three more potentially parameter-sensitive metrics for audio texture synthesis, (a) a Gram matrix based distance, (b) an Accumulated Gram metric using a summarized version of the Gram matrices, and (c) a cochlear-model based statistical features metric. These metrics use deep features that summarize the statistics of any given audio texture, thus being inherently sensitive to variations in the statistical parameters that define an audio texture. We study and evaluate the sensitivity of existing standard metrics as well as Gram matrix and cochlear-model based metrics in response to control-parameter variations for audio textures across a wide range of texture and parameter types, and validate with subjective evaluation. We find that each of the metrics is sensitive to different sets of texture-parameter types.

    "description": "Multi-modal music classification creates supervised models trained on features from different sources (modalities): the audio signal, the score, lyrics, album covers, expert tags, etc. A concept of \"multi-group feature importance\" not only helps to measure the individual relevance of features of a feature type under investigation (such as the instruments present in a piece), but also serves to quantify the potential for further improving classification by adding features from other feature types or extracted from different kinds of sources, based on a multi-objective analysis of feature sets after evolutionary feature selection. In this study, we investigate the stability of feature group importance when different classification methods and different measures of classification quality are applied. Since musical scores are particularly helpful in deriving semantically meaningful, robust genre characteristics, we focus on the feature groups analyzed by the jSymbolic feature extraction software, which describe properties associated with instrumentation, basic pitch statistics, melody, chords, tempo, and other rhythmic aspects. These symbolic features are analyzed in the context of musical information drawn from five other modalities, and experiments are conducted involving two datasets, one small and one large. The results show that, although some feature groups can remain similarly important compared to others, differences can also be evident in various applications, and can depend on the particular classifier and evaluation measure being used. Insights drawn from this type of analysis can potentially be helpful in effectively matching specific features or feature groups to particular classifiers and evaluation measures in future feature-based MIR research.",

    "description": "The performance of machine learning (ML) models is known to be affected by discrepancies between training (source) and real-world (target) data distributions. This problem is referred to as domain shift and is commonly approached using domain adaptation (DA) methods. As one relevant scenario, automatic piano transcription algorithms in music learning applications potentially suffer from domain shift since pianos are recorded in different acoustic conditions using various devices. Yet, most currently available datasets for piano transcription only cover ideal recording situations with high-quality microphones. Consequently, a transcription model trained on these datasets will face a mismatch between source and target data in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we employ a recently proposed dataset which includes annotated piano recordings covering typical real-life recording settings for a piano learning application on mobile devices. We first quantify the influence of the domain shift on the performance of a deep learning-based piano multi-pitch estimation (MPE) algorithm. Then, we employ and evaluate four unsupervised DA methods to reduce domain shift. Our results show that the studied MPE model is surprisingly robust to domain shift in microphone mismatch scenarios and the DA methods do not notably improve the transcription performance.",

A key challenge in *melody transcription* is building methods which can handle broad audio containing any number of instrument ensembles and musical styles---existing strategies work well for some melody instruments or styles but not all. To confront this challenge, we leverage representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020), a generative model of broad music audio, thereby improving performance on melody transcription by 20% relative to conventional spectrogram features. Another obstacle in melody transcription is a lack of training data---we derive a new dataset containing 50 hours of melody transcriptions from crowdsourced annotations of broad music. The combination of generative pre-training and a new dataset for this task results in 77% stronger performance on melody transcription relative to the strongest available baseline. By pairing our new melody transcription approach with solutions for beat detection, key estimation, and chord recognition, we build a system capable of transcribing human-readable lead sheets directly from music audio.",

    "description": "Music source separation (MSS) aims at decomposing a music recording into constituent sources, such as a lead instrument and the accompaniment. Despite the difficulties in MSS due to the high correlation of musical sources in time and frequency, deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to substantial improvements to accomplish this task. For training supervised machine learning models such as DNNs, isolated sources are required. In the case of popular music, one can exploit open-source datasets which involve multitrack recordings of vocals, bass, and drums. For western classical music, however, isolated sources are generally not available. In this article, we consider the case of piano concertos, which are composed for a pianist typically accompanied by an orchestra. The lack of multitrack recordings makes training supervised machine learning models for the separation of piano and orchestra challenging. To overcome this problem, we generate artificial training material by randomly mixing sections of the solo piano repertoire (e.g., piano sonatas) and orchestral pieces without piano (e.g., symphonies) to train state-of-the-art DNN models for MSS. As our main contribution, we propose a test-time adaptation (TTA) procedure, which exploits random mixtures of the piano-only and orchestra-only parts in the test data to further improve the separation quality.",

In this paper, we evaluate whether the use of automatic counterpoint error-detection tools makes the correction process more efficient. The results confirm that marking illegal dissonances in the score following the rules of Renaissance counterpoint indeed makes the process of editorial correction of scribal errors in Renaissance music more efficient by reducing the time taken and improving the accuracy of such corrections. Moreover, marking the illegal dissonances in the score also allowed us to catch OMR errors that had passed through undetected at a previous stage of the workflow.",

While prior neural approaches have often treated this as a sequence tagging problem with independent predictions, we put forward a checklist system, trained via reinforcement learning, that maintains a representation of recent predictions in addition to a hidden state, allowing it to learn soft constraints on output structure. We also demonstrate that by modifying input representations --- which in prior work using neural models have often taken the form of one-hot encodings over individual keys on the piano --- to encode relative position on the keyboard to the prior note instead, we can achieve much better performance. Additionally, we reassess the use of raw per-note labeling precision as an evaluation metric, noting that it does not adequately measure the fluency, i.e. human playability, of a model's output. To this end, we compare methods across several statistics which track the frequency of adjacent finger predictions that while independently reasonable would be physically challenging to perform in sequence, and implement a reinforcement learning strategy to minimize these as part of our training loss. Finally through human expert evaluation, we demonstrate significant gains in performability directly attributable to improvements with respect to these metrics.",

A latent coordinate system enables generating arbitrarily long sequences of excerpts in parallel, while a global context vector allows the music to remain stylistically coherent through time.

In this paper, we confirmed that this domain mismatch negatively affect the performance of the music source separation networks. To this end, we first created the out-of-domain evaluation datasets, musdb-L and XL, by mimicking the music mastering process. Then, we quantitatively verify that the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms significantly deteriorated in our datasets. Lastly, we proposed LimitAug data augmentation method to reduce the domain mismatch, which utilizes an online limiter during the training data sampling process. We confirmed that it not only alleviates the performance degradation on our out-of-domain datasets, but also results in higher performance on in-domain data.",

    "description": "There are many benefits for a community when there is a vibrant local music scene (e.g., increased mental & physical well-being, increased economic activity) and there are many factors that contribute to an environment in which a live music scene can thrive (e.g., available performance spaces, helpful government policies). In this paper, we explore using an estimate of the live music event rate (LMER) as a rough indicator to measure the strength of a local music scene. We define LMER as the number of music shows per 100,000 people per year and then explore how this indicator is (or is not) correlated with 28 other socioeconomic indicators. To do this, we analyze a set of 308,051 music events from 2019 across 1,139 cities in the United States. Our findings reveal that factors related to transportation (e.g., high walkability), population (high density), economics (high employment rate), age (high proportion of individuals age 20-29), and education (bachelor's degree or higher) are strongly correlated with having a high number of live music events. Conversely, we did not find statistically significant evidence that other indica- tors (e.g., racial diversity) are correlated.",

Despite promising results achieved by such representations, dealing with the inherent hierarchical aspect of music structure remains a challenging problem. Because different levels of segmentation can be considered as equally valid, specifically designed representations should be optimized to improve hierarchical structure analysis. In this work, we explore unsupervised learning of such representations using a contrastive approach operating at different time-scales. We evaluate the proposed system on flat and multi-level music segmentation. By leveraging both time and the hierarchical organization of music structure, we show that the obtained deep embeddings can encode meaningful patterns and improve segmentation at various levels of granularity.",

    "description": "An ideal music synthesizer should be both interactive and expressive, generating high-fidelity audio in realtime for arbitrary combinations of instruments and notes. Recent neural synthesizers have exhibited a tradeoff between domain-specific models that offer detailed control of only specific instruments, or raw waveform models that can train on any music but with minimal control and slow generation. In this work, we focus on a middle ground of neural synthesizers that can generate audio from MIDI sequences with arbitrary combinations of instruments in realtime. This enables training on a wide range of transcription datasets with a single model, which in turn offers note-level control of composition and instrumentation across a wide range of instruments. We use a simple two-stage process: MIDI to spectrograms with an encoder-decoder Transformer, then spectrograms to audio with a generative adversarial network (GAN) spectrogram inverter. We compare training the decoder as an autoregressive model and as a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and find that the DDPM approach is superior both qualitatively and as measured by audio reconstruction and Fr\u00e9chet distance metrics. Given the interactivity and generality of this approach, we find this to be a promising first step towards interactive and expressive neural synthesis for arbitrary combinations of instruments and notes.",

    "description": "FM Synthesis is a well-known algorithm used to generate complex timbre from a compact set of design primitives. Typically featuring a MIDI interface, it is usually impractical to control it from an audio source. On the other hand, Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) has enabled nuanced audio rendering by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that learn to control differentiable synthesis layers from arbitrary sound inputs. The training process involves a corpus of audio for supervision, and spectral reconstruction loss functions. Such functions, while being great to match spectral amplitudes, present a lack of pitch direction which can hinder the joint optimization of the parameters of FM synthesizers. In this paper, we take steps towards enabling continuous control of a well-established FM synthesis architecture from an audio input. Firstly, we discuss a set of design constraints that ease spectral optimization of a differentiable FM synthesizer via a standard reconstruction loss. Next, we present Differentiable DX7 (DDX7), a lightweight architecture for neural FM resynthesis of musical instrument sounds in terms of a compact set of parameters. We train the model on instrument samples extracted from the URMP dataset, and quantitatively demonstrate its comparable audio quality against selected benchmarks.",

    "description": "Tracking beats of singing voices without the presence of musical accompaniment can find many applications in music production, automatic song arrangement, and social media interaction. Its main challenge is the lack of strong rhythmic and harmonic patterns that are important for music rhythmic analysis in general. Even for human listeners, this can be a challenging task. As a result, existing music beat tracking systems fail to deliver satisfactory performance on singing voices. In this paper, we propose singing beat tracking as a novel task, and propose the first approach to solving this task. Our approach leverages semantic information of singing voices by employing pre-trained self-supervised WavLM and DistilHuBERT speech representations as the front-end and uses a self-attention encoder layer to predict beats. To train and test the system, we obtain separated singing voices and their beat annotations using source separation and beat tracking on complete songs, followed by manual corrections. Experiments on the 741 separated vocal tracks of the GTZAN dataset show that the proposed system outperforms several state-of-the-art music beat tracking methods by a large margin in terms of beat tracking accuracy. Ablation studies also confirm the advantages of pre-trained self-supervised speech representations over generic spectral features.",

The advances in this field can be directly attributed to the availability of large-scale multitrack research datasets for these mentioned stems. Tasks such as separating similar-sounding sources from an ensemble recording have seen limited research due to the lack of sizeable, bleed-free multitrack datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel multitrack dataset called EnsembleSet generated using the Spitfire BBC Symphony Orchestra library using ensemble scores from RWC Classical Music Database and Mutopia. Our data generation method introduces automated articulation mapping for different playing styles based on the input MIDI/MusicXML data. The sample library also enables us to render the dataset with 20 different mix/microphone configurations allowing us to study various recording scenarios for each performance. The dataset presents 80 tracks (6+ hours) with a range of string, wind, and brass instruments arranged as chamber ensembles. We also present our benchmark on our synthesised dataset using a permutation-invariant time-domain separation model for chamber ensembles which produces generalisable results when tested on real recordings from existing datasets.",

    "description": "This paper presents an automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) method for music recordings that leverages the framewise semitone-level sung pitches estimated in a multi-task learning framework. Compared to automatic speech recognition (ASR), ALT is challenging due to the insufficiency of training data and the variation and contamination of acoustic features caused by singing expressions and accompaniment sounds. The domain adaptation approach has thus recently been taken for updating an ASR model pre-trained from sufficient speech data. In the naive application of the end-to-end approach to ALT, the internal audio-to-lyrics alignment often fails due to the time-stretching nature of singing features. To stabilize the alignment, we make use of the semi-synchronous relationships between notes and characters. Specifically, a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) is used for estimating the semitone-level pitches with note onset times while eliminating the intra- and inter-note pitch variations. This estimate helps an end-to-end ALT model based on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) learn correct audio-to-character alignment and mapping, where the ALT model is trained jointly with the pitch and onset estimation model. The experimental results show the usefulness of the pitch and onset information in ALT.",

Our experiments show that our method performs significantly better than the baselines at retrieving audio that matches a textual description and, conversely, text that matches an audio query.

However, the nature of repetition and structure in music is still not well understood, especially in the context of music generation, and much remains to be explored with Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques. Analyses of two popular music datasets (Chinese and American) illustrate important music construction principles: (1) structure exists at multiple hierarchical levels, (2) songs use repetition and limited vocabulary so that individual songs do not follow general statistics of song collections, (3) structure interacts with rhythm, melody, harmony, and predictability, and (4) over the course of a song, repetition is not random, but follows a general trend as revealed by cross-entropy. These and other findings offer challenges as well as opportunities for deep-learning music generation and suggest new formal music criteria and evaluation methods.

However, building a structure that incorporates different modalities in a unique space to represent the songs is challenging. Integrating information from related instances by learning heterogeneous graph-based representations has achieved state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks. This paper proposes structuring musical features over a heterogeneous network and learning a multi-modal representation using Graph Convolutional Networks with features extracted from audio and lyrics as inputs to handle the music emotion recognition tasks.

In this work, we build upon these recent advances and propose a metric learning-based system systematically leveraging four dimensions commonly admitted to convey musical similarity between versions: melodic line, harmonic structure, rhythmic patterns, and lyrics. We describe our deliberately simple model architecture, and we show in particular that an approximated representation of the lyrics is an efficient proxy to discriminate between versions and non-versions. We then describe how these features complement each other and yield new state-of-the-art performances on two publicly available datasets. We finally suggest that a VI system using a combination of melodic, harmonic, rhythmic and lyrics features could theoretically reach the optimal performances obtainable on these datasets.",

Using a dataset of Romantic string quartets, we train a variant of the Transformer network architecture on the task of classifying each symbol of an optically-recognized musical piece in symbolic format as correct or erroneous, based on whether a manual correction of the piece would require an insertion, deletion, or replacement of a symbol at that location. Since we have a limited amount of data with real OMR errors, we employ extensive data augmentation to add errors into training data in a way that mimics how OMR would modify the score. Our best-performing models achieve 99% recall and 50% precision on this error-detection task.",

    "description": "This study explores the association between music preferences and moral values by applying text analysis techniques to lyrics. Harvesting data from a Facebook-hosted application, we align psychometric scores of 1,386 users to lyrics from the top 5 songs of their preferred music artists as emerged from Facebook Page Likes. We extract a set of lyrical features related to each song's overarching narrative, moral valence, sentiment, and emotion. A machine learning framework was designed to exploit regression ap- proaches and evaluate the predictive power of lyrical features for inferring moral values. Results suggest that lyrics from top songs of artists people like inform their morality. Virtues of hierarchy and tradition achieve higher prediction scores (.20 \u2264 r \u2264 .30) than values of empathy and equality (.08 \u2264 r \u2264 .11), while basic demographic variables only account for a small part in the models' explainability. This shows the importance of music listening behaviours, as assessed via lyrical preferences, alone in capturing moral values. We discuss the technological and musicological implications and possible future improvements.",

    "description": "Recent advances in deep learning not only facilitate the implementation of zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) and singing voice conversion (SVC) tasks but also provide the opportunity to unify these two tasks into one generalized model. In this paper, we propose such a model that generate the singing voice of any target singer from any source singing content in either text or audio format. The model incorporates self-supervised joint training of the phonetic encoder and the acoustic encoder, with an audio-to-phoneme alignment process in each training step, such that these encoders map the audio and text data respectively into a shared, temporally aligned, and singer agnostic latent space. The target singer's latent representations encoded at different granularity levels are all trained to match the source latent representations sequentially with the attention mechanisms in the decoding stage. This enables the model to generate unseen target singer's voice with fine-grained resolution from either text or audio sources. Both objective and subjective experiments confirmed that the proposed model is competitive with the state-of-the-art SVC and SVS methods.",

Controllability is essential for building creative tools from such models. Recent work in this area has focused on disentangled latent space representations, but this is only part of the solution. Efficient control of semantic attributes must handle non-linearities and holes that occur in latent spaces, whilst minimising unwanted changes to other attributes. This paper introduces SeNT-Gen, a neural traversal algorithm that uses a secondary neural network to model the complex relationships between latent codes and musical attributes. This enables precise editing of semantic attributes that adapts to context. We demonstrate the method using the dMelodies dataset, and show strong performance for several VAE models.",

First, we exploit the public editorial metadata available on Discogs, an extensive community-maintained music database containing information about artists, releases, and record labels. Second, we use a contrastive learning setup based on COLA, different from previous systems based on triplet loss. We train models targeting several associations derived from the metadata and experiment with stacked combinations of learned representations, evaluating them on standard music classification tasks. Additionally, we consider learning all the associations jointly in a multi-task setup. We show that it is possible to improve the performance of current self-supervised models by using inexpensive metadata commonly available in music collections, producing representations comparable to those learned on classification setups. We find that the resulting representations based on editorial metadata outperform a system trained with music style tags available in the same large-scale dataset, which motivates further research using this type of supervision. Additionally, we give insights on how to preprocess Discogs metadata to build training objectives and provide public pre-trained models.",

While existing infilling approaches can generate a passage that connects smoothly locally with the given contexts, they do not take into account the musical form or structure of the music and may therefore generate overly smooth results. To address this issue, we propose a structure-aware conditioning approach that employs a novel attention-selecting module to supply user-provided structure-related information to the Transformer for infilling. With both objective and subjective evaluations, we show that the proposed model can harness the structural information effectively and generate melodies in the style of pop of higher quality than the two existing structure-agnostic infilling models.",

However, many existing symbolic MIR systems neglect melody track identification (MTI) and are thus less effective.

To address this problem, we propose a CNN-Transformer-based MTI model designed to robustly identify a single melody track for a given MIDI file. As this process can take a sizable amount of time for long songs, we also use a sparse Transformer to speed up attention computation.

To address these problems and overcome dataset-dependent limitations that inhibit the successful training of deep learning models, we pursue representation learning to train generalized embeddings that can be used for a wide variety of sound effects libraries and are a taxonomy-agnostic representation of sound. We show that a task-specific but dataset-independent representation can successfully address data issues such as class imbalance, inconsistent class labels, and insufficient dataset size, outperforming established representations such as OpenL3.

Previous approaches for this task have commonly used textual features extracted from the entirety of a song's lyrics, neglecting the inherent structure of lyrics consisting of, for instance, verses and choruses. Therefore, we pose the hypothesis that features extracted from different parts of the lyrics can have significantly different predictive power. To test this hypothesis, we perform a series of experiments to determine whether models trained on features taken from verses and choruses perform differently for genre recognition. Our experiments indeed confirm our hypothesis, showing that generally, using features extracted from verses leads to higher performance than features extracted from choruses. Digging deeper, we found that this is especially true for pop and rap songs. Rock songs show the opposite effect, with features extracted from choruses performing better than those taken from verses.",

To fill in the performance gap between ALT and ASR, we attempt to exploit the similarities between speech and singing. In this work, we propose a transfer-learning-based ALT solution that takes advantage of these similarities by adapting wav2vec 2.0, an SSL ASR model, to the singing domain. We maximize the effectiveness of transfer learning by exploring the influence of different transfer starting points. We further enhance the performance by extending the original CTC model to a hybrid CTC/attention model. Our method surpasses previous approaches by a large margin on various ALT benchmark datasets.

Dataset curation cannot be crowdsourced; one needs trained musicians to devote sizable effort to carry out such annotations. Further, such an analysis is not simple for beginners; obtaining labeled data that can capture the nuances of a musician's reasoning acquired over years of practice is fraught with challenges. To this end, we provide a system for computational analysis of classical music, both for machine learning and music researchers. First, we introduce a labeled dataset containing 200 classical music pieces annotated by form and phrases. Then, by leveraging this dataset, we show that deep learning-based methods can be used to learn Form Classification as well as Phrase Analysis and Classification, for which few (if any) results have been reported yet. Taken together, we provide the community with a unique dataset as well as a toolkit needed to analyze classical music structure, which can be used or extended to drive applications in both commercial and educational settings.",

Detecting such structures is vital for numerous MIR tasks such as musicological analysis, key detection, music segmentation, and others. However, automatic cadence detection remains a challenging task mainly because it involves a combination of high-level musical elements like harmony, voice leading, and rhythm. In this work, we present a graph representation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence detection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node classification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results that are at least on par with the state of the art, and we present a model capable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from individual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note representation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution is able to learn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the need of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context. We argue that this general approach to modeling musical scores and classification tasks has a number of potential advantages, beyond the specific recognition task presented here.",

    "description": "The variational auto-encoder has become a leading framework for symbolic music generation, and a popular research direction is to study how to effectively control the generation process. A straightforward way is to control a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to listen to the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially induces a condition-invariant representation. In this paper, we focus on the task of melody harmonization to illustrate our idea, while our methodology can be generalized to other controllable generative tasks. Demos and experiments show that our methodology facilitates not only condition-invariant representation learning but also higher-quality controllability compared to baselines.",

However, most studies merely focus on synthesized sound, and the induced theories on natural tones with complex timbre has rarely been justified. To this end, we investigate both theory and applications of natural-tone loudness perception in this paper via modeling piano tone. The theory part contains: 1) an accurate measurement of piano-tone equal-loudness contour of pitches, and 2) a machine-learning model capable of inferring loudness purely based on spectral features trained on human subject measurements. As for the application, we apply our theory to piano control transfer, in which we adjust the MIDI velocities on two different player pianos (in different acoustic environments) to achieve the same perceptual effect. Experiments show that both of our theoretical loudness modeling and the corresponding performance control transfer algorithm significantly outperform their baselines.",

Performance of all factor combinations are measured on two distinct tagging datasets, namely MagnaTagATune and MTG Jamendo.

These models generally require large amounts of (annotated) training data to achieve high accuracy. Because not all applications in MIR have sufficient quantities of training data, it is becoming increasingly common to transfer models across domains. This approach allows representations derived for one task to be applied to another, and can result in high accuracy with less stringent training data requirements for the downstream task. However, the properties of pre-trained audio embeddings are not fully understood. Specifically, and unlike traditionally engineered features, the representations extracted from pre-trained deep networks may embed and propagate biases from the model's training regime. This work investigates the phenomenon of bias propagation in the context of pre-trained audio representations for the task of instrument recognition. We first demonstrate that three different pre-trained representations (VGGish, OpenL3, and YAMNet) exhibit comparable performance when constrained to a single dataset, but differ in their ability to generalize across datasets (OpenMIC and IRMAS). We then investigate dataset identity and genre distribution as potential sources of bias.

    "description": "Symbolic music is widely used in various deep learning tasks, including generation, transcription, synthesis, and Music Information Retrieval (MIR). It is mostly employed with discrete models like Transformers, which require music to be tokenized, i.e., formatted into sequences of distinct elements called tokens. Tokenization can be performed in different ways, and recent research has focused on developing more efficient methods. However, the key differences between these methods are often unclear, and few studies have compared them. In this work, we analyze the current common tokenization methods and experiment with time and note duration representations. We compare the performance of these two impactful criteria on several tasks, including composer classification, emotion classification, music generation, and sequence representation. We demonstrate that explicit information leads to better results depending on the task.",

    "description": "Micro-timing is an essential part of human music-making, yet it is absent from most computer music systems. Partly to address this gap, we present a novel system for generating music with style-specific micro-timing within the Sonic Pi live coding language. We use a probabilistic approach to control the exact timing according to patterns discovered in new analyses of existing micro-timing data (jembe drumming and Viennese waltz). This implementation also required the introduction of musical metre into Sonic Pi. The new metre and micro-timing systems are inherently flexible, and thus open to a wide range of creative possibilities including (but not limited to): creating new micro-timing profiles for additional styles; expanded definitions of metre; and the free mixing of one micro-timing style with the musical content of another. The code is freely available as a Sonic Pi plug-in and released open source at https://github.com/MaxTheComputerer/sonicpi-metre.",

    "description": "Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a well-established research field focused on the task of reading musical notation from images of music scores. In the standard OMR workflow, layout analysis is a critical component for identifying relevant parts of the image, such as staff lines, text, or notes. State-of-the-art approaches to this task are based on machine learning, which entails having to label a training corpus, an error-prone, laborious, and expensive task that must be performed by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot strategy for building robust models by utilizing only partial annotations, therefore requiring minimal human effort. Specifically, we introduce a masking layer and an oversampling technique to train models using a small set of annotated patches from the training images. Our proposal enables achieving high performance even with scarce training data, as demonstrated by experiments on four benchmark datasets. The results indicate that this approach achieves performance values comparable to models trained with a fully annotated corpus, but, in this case, requiring the annotation of only between 20% and 39% of this data.",

    "description": "Drummers spend extensive time practicing rudiments to develop technique, speed, coordination, and phrasing. These rudiments are often practiced on \"silent\" practice pads using only the hands. Additionally, many percussive instruments across cultures are played exclusively with the hands. Building on these concepts and inspired by Einstein's probably apocryphal quote, \"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler,\" we hypothesize that a dual-voice reduction could serve as a natural and meaningful compressed representation of multi-voiced drum patterns. This representation would retain more information than its corresponding monotonic representation while maintaining relative simplicity for tasks such as rhythm analysis and generation. To validate this potential representation, we investigate whether experienced drummers can consistently represent and reproduce the rhythmic essence of a given drum pattern using only their two hands. We present TapTamDrum: a novel dataset of repeated dualizations from four experienced drummers, along with preliminary analysis and tools for further exploration of the data.",

We develop RT-MIR techniques aimed at augmenting percussive fingerstyle, which blends acoustic guitar playing with guitar body percussion. We formulate several design objectives for RT-MIR systems for augmented instrument performance: (i) causal constraint, (ii) perceptually negligible action-to-sound latency, (iii) control intimacy support, (iv) synthesis control support. We present and evaluate real-time guitar body percussion recognition and embedding learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNNs jointly trained with variational autoencoders (VAEs). We introduce a taxonomy of guitar body percussion based on hand part and location. We follow a cross-dataset evaluation approach by collecting three datasets labelled according to the taxonomy. The embedding quality of the models is assessed using KL-Divergence across distributions corresponding to different taxonomic classes. Results indicate that the networks are strong classifiers especially in a simplified 2-class recognition task, and the VAEs yield improved class separation compared to CNNs as evidenced by increased KL-Divergence across distributions. We argue that the VAE embedding quality could support control intimacy and rich interaction when the latent space's parameters are used to control an external synthesis engine. Further design challenges around generalisation to different datasets have been identified.",

    "description": "Recent text-to-audio generation techniques have the potential to allow novice users to freely generate music audio. Even if they do not have musical knowledge, such as about chord progressions and instruments, users can try various text prompts to generate audio. However, compared to the image domain, gaining a clear understanding of the space of possible music audios is difficult because users cannot listen to the variations of the generated audios simultaneously. We therefore facilitate users in exploring not only text prompts but also audio priors that constrain the text-to-audio music generation process. This dual-sided exploration enables users to discern the impact of different text prompts and audio priors on the generation results through iterative comparison of them. Our developed interface, IteraTTA, is specifically designed to aid users in refining text prompts and selecting favorable audio priors from the generated audios. With this, users can progressively reach their loosely-specified goals while understanding and exploring the space of possible results. Our implementation and discussions highlight design considerations that are specifically required for text-to-audio models and how interaction techniques can contribute to their effectiveness.",

In this work, we introduce the problem of musical instrument retrieval based on the directivity pattern features. We aim to exploit the available similarity metrics for directivity patterns in order to determine distances between instruments. We apply the methodology to a data set of violin directivities, including historical and modern high-quality instruments.

    "description": "Computational models and analyses of musical rhythms are predominantly based on the subdivision of durations down to a common isochronous pulse, which plays a fundamental structural role in the organization of their durational patterns. Meter, the most widespread example of such a temporal scheme, consists of several hierarchically organized pulses. Deviations from isochrony found in musical patterns are considered to form an expressive, micro level of organization that is distinct from the structural macro-organization of the basic pulse. However, polyrhythmic structures, such as those found in music from West Africa or the African diaspora, challenge both the hierarchical subdivision of durations and the structural isochrony of the above models. Here we present a model that integrates the macro- and micro-organization of rhythms by generating non-isochronous girds from isochronous pulses within a polyrhythmic structure. Observed micro-timing patterns may then be generated from structural non-isochronous grids, rather than being understood as expressive deviations from isochrony. We examine the basic mathematical properties of the model and show that meter can be generated as a special case. Finally, we demonstrate the model in the analysis of micro-timing patterns observed in Brazilian samba performances.",

Evidence from musicology and psychology research shows that gender-loaded messages can be reliably encoded and decoded via musical sounds. However, much of this evidence comes from examining music in isolation, while studies of the gendering of music within multimodal communicative events are sparse. In this paper, we outline a method to automatically analyse how music in TV advertising aimed at children may be deliberately used to reinforce traditional gender roles. Our dataset of 606 commercials included music-focused mid-level perceptual features, multimodal aesthetic emotions, and content analytical items. Despite its limited size, and because of the extreme gender polarisation inherent in toy advertisements, we obtained noteworthy results by leveraging multi-task transfer learning on our densely annotated dataset. The models were trained to categorise commercials based on their intended target audience, specifically distinguishing between masculine, feminine, and mixed audiences. Additionally, to provide explainability for the classification in gender targets, the models were jointly trained to perform regressions on emotion ratings across six scales, and on mid-level musical perceptual attributes across twelve scales. Standing in the context of MIR, computational social studies and critical analysis, this study may benefit not only music scholars but also advertisers, policymakers, and broadcasters.",

    "description": "Nowadays, humans are constantly exposed to music, whether through voluntary streaming services or incidental encounters during commercial breaks. Despite the abundance of music, certain pieces remain more memorable and often gain greater popularity. Inspired by this phenomenon, we focus on measuring and predicting music memorability. To achieve this, we collect a new music piece dataset with reliable memorability labels using a novel interactive experimental procedure. We then train baselines to predict and analyze music memorability, leveraging both interpretable features and audio mel-spectrograms as inputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore music memorability using data-driven deep learning-based methods. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that while there is room for improvement, predicting music memorability with limited data is possible. Certain intrinsic elements, such as higher valence, arousal, and faster tempo, contribute to memorable music. As prediction techniques continue to evolve, real-life applications like music recommendation systems and music style transfer will undoubtedly benefit from this new area of research.",

    "description": "Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is the field of research that studies how to computationally read music notation from written documents. Thanks to recent advances in computer vision and deep learning, there are successful approaches that can locate the music-notation elements from a given music score image. Once detected, these elements must be related to each other to reconstruct the musical notation itself, in the so-called notation assembly stage. However, despite its relevance in the eventual success of the OMR, this stage has been barely addressed in the literature. This work presents a set of neural approaches to perform this assembly stage. Taking into account the number of possible syntactic relationships in a music score, we give special importance to the efficiency of the process in order to obtain useful models in practice. Our experiments, using the MUSCIMA++ handwritten sheet music dataset, show that the considered approaches are capable of outperforming the existing state of the art in terms of efficiency with limited (or no) performance degradation. We believe that the conclusions of this work provide novel insights into the notation assembly step, while indicating clues on how to approach the previous stages of the OMR and improve the overall performance.",

Such optimization tasks benefit from access to accurate gradients. However, typical audio synths incorporate components with discontinuities \u2013 such as sawtooth or square waveforms, or a categorical search over discrete parameters like a choice among such waveforms \u2013 that thwart conventional automatic differentiation (AD). AD libraries in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch typically ignore discontinuities, providing incorrect gradients at such locations. Thus, SOTA parameter inference methods avoid differentiating the synth directly, and resort to workarounds such as genetic search or neural proxies. Instead, we adapt and extend recent computer graphics methods for differentiable rendering to directly differentiate the synth as a white box program, and thereby optimize its parameters using gradient descent. We evaluate our framework using a generic FM synth with ADSR, noise, and IIR filters, adapting its parameters to match a variety of target audio clips.

Comparing classification based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM) further revealed similar neural encoding of vocals and mixed sources, despite vocals being most easily identifiable.

Then, a Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is utilized to achieve multi-scale context fusion and capture emotion-critical features in both spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, a BiLSTM-based sequence learning model is employed for dynamic music emotion prediction. To enrich existing music emotion datasets, we developed a high-quality dataset, MER1101, which has a balanced emotional distribution, covering over 10 genres, at least four languages, and more than a thousand song snippets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DAMFF approach on both the developed MER1101 dataset, as well as on the established DEAM2015 dataset.

The first hierarchy includes a convolutional block in the time axis, a Transformer encoder in the frequency axis, and a Transformer decoder that converts the dimension in the frequency axis.

We show that by using internal and external controls, Polyffusion unifies a wide range of music creation tasks, including melody generation given accompaniment, accompaniment generation given melody, arbitrary music segment inpainting, and music arrangement given chords or textures.

Most state-of-the-art approaches for MPE are based on deep networks trained using pitch annotations as targets. The success of current methods is therefore limited by the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of accurate annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for learning MPE without any pitch annotations at all. Our approach exploits multiple recorded versions of a musical piece as surrogate targets. Given one version of a piece as input, we train a network to minimize the distance between its output and time-frequency representations of other versions of that piece. Since all versions are based on the same musical score, we hypothesize that the learned output corresponds to pitch estimates. To further ensure that this hypothesis holds, we incorporate domain knowledge about overtones and noise levels into the network. Overall, our method replaces strong pitch annotations with weaker and easier-to-obtain cross-version targets. In our experiments, we show that our proposed approach yields viable multi-pitch estimates and outperforms two baselines.",

    "description": "Generating a stereophonic presentation from a monophonic audio signal is a challenging open task, especially if the goal is to obtain a realistic spatial imaging with a specific panning of sound elements. In this work, we propose to convert mono to stereo by means of predicting parametric stereo (PS) parameters using both nearest neighbor and deep network approaches. In combination with PS, we also propose to model the task with generative approaches, allowing to synthesize multiple and equally-plausible stereo renditions from the same mono signal. To achieve this, we consider both autoregressive and masked token modelling approaches. We provide evidence that the proposed PS-based models outperform a competitive classical decorrelation baseline and that, within a PS prediction framework, modern generative models outshine equivalent non-generative counterparts. Overall, our work positions both PS and generative modelling as strong and appealing methodologies for mono-to-stereo upmixing. A discussion of the limitations of these approaches is also provided.",

    "description": "Recent developments in MIR have led to several benchmark deep learning models whose embeddings can be used for a variety of downstream tasks. At the same time, the vast majority of these models have been trained on Western pop/rock music and related styles. This leads to research questions on whether these models can be used to learn representations for different music cultures and styles, or whether we can build similar music audio embedding models trained on data from different cultures or styles. To that end, we leverage transfer learning methods to derive insights about the similarities between the different music cultures to which the data belongs to. We use two Western music datasets, two traditional/folk datasets coming from eastern Mediterranean cultures, and two datasets belonging to Indian art music. Three deep audio embedding models are trained and transferred across domains, including two CNN-based and a Transformer-based architecture, to perform auto-tagging for each target domain dataset. Experimental results show that competitive performance is achieved in all domains via transfer learning, while the best source dataset varies for each music culture. The implementation and the trained models are both provided in a public repository.",

    "description": "Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has become a popular technology to retrieve information present in musical scores in conjunction with the increasing improvement of Deep Learning techniques, which represent the state-of-the-art in the field. However, its effectiveness is limited to cases where the target collection is similar in musical context and graphical appearance to the available training examples. To address this limitation, researchers have resorted to labeling examples for specific neural models, which is time-consuming and raises questions about usability. In this study, we propose a holistic and comprehensive study for dealing with new music collections in OMR, including extensive experiments to identify key aspects to have in mind that lead to better performance ratios. We resort to collections written in Mensural notation as specific use case, comprising 5 different corpora of training domains and up to 15 test collections.

For each selection, respondents were asked: \"Why do you love the excerpt? Try to be as specific and detailed as possible (music theory terms are encouraged but not required).\" Classical selections were dominated by a very small number of composers, while the pop and jazz artists were diverse. A thematic coding of the respondents' comments found that the most common themes were melody (34.2% of comments), harmony (27.2%), and sonic factors: texture (27.6%), instrumentation (24.3%), and timbre (12.5%). (Rhythm (19.5%) and meter (4.6%) were less present in the comments.) The comments cite simplicity three times more than complexity, and energy gain 14 times more than energy decrease, suggesting that people's favorite excerpts involve simple moments of energy gain or \"build-up\".

    "description": "In piano performance, some mistakes stand out to listeners, whereas others may go unnoticed. Former research concluded that the salience of mistakes depended on factors including their contextual appropriateness and a listener's degree of familiarity to what is being performed. A conspicuous error is considered to be an area where there is something obviously wrong with the performance, which a listener can detect regardless of their degree of knowledge of what is being performed. Analogously, this paper attempts to build a score-independent conspicuous error detector for standard piano repertoire of beginner to intermediate students. We gather three qualitatively different piano playing MIDI data: (1) 103 sight-reading sessions for beginning and intermediate adult pianists with formal music training, (2) 245 performances by presumably late-beginner to early-advanced pianists on a digital piano, and (3) 50 etude performances by an advanced pianist. The data was annotated at the regions considered to contain conspicuous mistakes. Then, we use a Temporal Convolutional Network to detect the sites of such mistakes from the piano roll. We investigate the use of two pre-training methods to overcome data scarcity: (1) synthetic data with procedurally-generated mistakes, and (2) training a part of the model as a piano roll auto-encoder. Experimental evaluation shows that the TCN performs at an F-measure of 0.78 without pretraining for sight-reading data, but the proposed pretraining steps improve the F-measure on performance and etude data, approaching the agreement between human raters on conspicuous error labels. Importantly, we report on the lessons learned from this pilot study, and what should be addressed to continue this research direction.",

VampNet is non-autoregressive, leveraging a bidirectional transformer architecture that attends to all tokens in a forward pass. With just 36 sampling passes, VampNet can generate coherent high-fidelity musical waveforms. We show that by prompting VampNet in various ways, we can apply it to tasks like music compression, inpainting, outpainting, continuation, and looping with variation (vamping). Appropriately prompted, VampNet is capable of maintaining style, genre, instrumentation, and other high-level aspects of the music.

However, personal feedback from an expert instructor is seldom available on demand. The goal motivating this project is to build software that will provide comparably useful feedback to beginners, in order to supplement feedback from human instructors. To lay the groundwork for that, in this paper we investigate performance assessment criteria from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. We gathered 83 piano performances from 21 players. Each recording was evaluated by both expert piano instructors and novice players. This dataset is unique in that the novice evaluators are also players, and that both quantitative and qualitative evaluations are collected.

    "description": "Music retrieval and recommendation applications often rely on content features encoded as embeddings, which provide vector representations of items in a music dataset. Numerous complementary embeddings can be derived from processing items originally represented in several modalities, e.g., audio signals, user interaction data, or editorial data. However, data of any given modality might not be available for all items in any music dataset. In this work, we propose a method based on contrastive learning to combine embeddings from multiple modalities and explore the impact of the presence or absence of embeddings from diverse modalities in an artist similarity task. Experiments on two datasets suggest that our contrastive method outperforms single-modality embeddings and baseline algorithms for combining modalities, both in terms of artist retrieval accuracy and coverage. Improvements with respect to other methods are particularly significant for less popular query artists. We demonstrate our method successfully combines complementary information from diverse modalities, and is more robust to missing modality data (i.e., it better handles the retrieval of artists with different modality embeddings than the query artist's).",

In an effort towards a unified model of form, this paper proposes an integration of repetition structure (i.e., which segments of a piece occur several times) and formal templates (such as AABA). While repetition structure can be modeled using context-free grammars, most prior approaches allow for arbitrary grammar rules. Constraining the structure of the inferred rules to conform to a small set of templates (meta-rules) not only reduces the space of possible rules that need to be considered but also ensures that the resulting repetition grammar remains interpretable in the context of musical form. The resulting formalism can be extended to cases of varied repetition and thus constitutes a building block for a larger model of form.",

    "description": "Most melodies from the Western common practice period have a harmonic background, i.e., a succession of chords that fit the melody. In this paper we provide a novel approach to infer this harmonic background from the score notation of a melody. We first construct a pitch context vector for each note in the melody. This vector summarises the pitches that are in the preceding and following contexts of the note. Next, we use these pitch context vectors to generate a list of candidate chords for each note. The candidate chords fit the pitch context of a given note each with a computed strength. Finally, we find an optimal path through the chord candidates, employing a score function for the fitness of a given candidate chord. The algorithm chooses one chord for each note, optimizing the total score. A set of heuristics is incorporated in the score function. The system is heavily parameterised, extremely flexible, and does not need training. This creates a framework to experiment with harmonization of melodies. The output is evaluated by an expert survey, which yields convincing and positive results.",

    "description": "This paper proposes a text-to-lyrics generation method, aiming to provide lyric writing support by suggesting the generated lyrics to users who struggle to find the right words to convey their message. Previous studies on lyrics generation have focused on generating lyrics based on semantic constraints such as specific keywords, lyric style, and topics. However, these methods had limitations because users could not freely input their intentions as text. Even if such intentions can be given as input text, the lyrics generated from the input tend to contain similar wording, making it difficult to inspire the user. Our method is therefore developed to generate lyrics that (1) convey a message similar to the input text and (2) contain wording different from the input text. A straightforward approach of training a text-to-lyrics encoder-decoder is not feasible since there is no text-lyric paired data for this purpose. To overcome this issue, we divide the text-to-lyrics generation process into a two-step pipeline, eliminating the need for text-lyric paired data. (a) First, we use an existing text-to-image generation technique as a text analyzer to obtain an image that captures the meaning of the input text, ignoring the wording. (b) Next, we use our proposed image-to-lyrics encoder-decoder (I2L) to generate lyrics from the obtained image while preserving its meaning. The training of this I2L model only requires pairs of \"lyrics\" and \"images generated from lyrics\", which are readily prepared. In addition, we propose for the first time a lyrics generation method that reduces the risk of plagiarism by prohibiting the generation of uncommon phrases in the training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate lyrics with different phrasing while conveying a message similar to the input text.",

We study its impact on the learned representations through downstream music segmentation. Because musical repetitions can be of different natures, we give further insight on the role of the audio descriptors employed at the triplet mining stage as well as the trade-off existing between the quality of the triplets mined and the quantity of unlabelled data used for training.

Then, a classifier filters the graph of all possible dependency arcs to produce the dependency tree. One major benefit of this system is that it can be easily integrated into modern deep-learning pipelines. Moreover, since it does not rely on any particular symbolic grammar, it can consider multiple musical features simultaneously, make use of sequential context information, and produce partial results for noisy inputs. We test our approach on two datasets of musical trees -- time-span trees of monophonic note sequences and harmonic trees of jazz chord sequences -- and show that our approach outperforms previous methods.",

Typically, SDTW is used to iteratively compute and refine soft alignments that compensate for temporal deviations between the training data and its weakly annotated targets. One major problem is that a mismatch between the estimated soft alignments and the reference alignments in the early training stage leads to incorrect parameter updates, making the overall training procedure unstable. In this paper, we investigate such stability issues by considering the task of pitch class estimation from music recordings as an illustrative case study. In particular, we introduce and discuss three conceptually different strategies (a hyperparameter scheduling, a diagonal prior, and a sequence unfolding strategy) with the objective of stabilizing intermediate soft alignment results. Finally, we report on experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies and discuss efficiency and implementation issues.",

The encoder with low temporal resolution is suited to capture global features with more balanced data. The decoder with high temporal resolution is designed to predict beat times at a desired resolution. In the decoder, the global structure is considered by the cross attention between the global features and high-dimensional features. There are two key modifications in the proposed model: (1) adding 1D convolutional layers in the encoder and (2) replacing positional embedding by the upsampled encoder features in the decoder.

Therefore, it is essential to consider all stakeholders' goals and values when developing and evaluating the music recommender systems integrated into these services. One vital goal is treating artists fairly, thereby giving them a fair chance to have their music recommended and listened to, and subsequently building a fan base. Such artist fairness is often assumed to have a trade-off with user goals such as satisfaction. Using insights from two studies, this work shows the opposite: some goals from different stakeholders are complementary. Our first study, in which we interview music artists, demonstrates that they often see increased transparency and control for users as a means to also improve artist fairness. We expand with a second study asking other music industry professionals about these topics using a questionnaire.

In response, this paper introduces the Digital Musicology Corpus Analysis Toolkit (DiMCAT), a Python library for processing large corpora of digitally encoded musical scores. Equally aimed at music-analytical corpus studies, MIR, and machine-learning research, DiMCAT performs common data transformations and analyses using dataframes. Dataframes reduce the inherent complexity of atomic score contents (e.g., notes), larger score entities (e.g., measures), and abstractions (e.g., chord symbols) into easily manipulable computational structures, whose vectorized operations scale to large quantities of musical material. The design of DiMCAT's API prioritizes computational speed and ease of use, thus aiming to cater to machine-learning practitioners and musicologists alike.",

    "description": "We propose multiple methods for effectively training a sequence-to-sequence automatic guitar transcription model which uses tokenized music representation as an output. Our proposed method mainly consists of 1) a hybrid CTC-Attention model for sequence-to-sequence automatic guitar transcription that uses tokenized music representation, and 2) two data augmentation methods for training the model. Our proposed model is a generic encoder-decoder Transformer model but adopts multi-task learning with CTC from the encoder to speed up learning alignments between the output tokens and acoustic features. Our proposed data augmentation methods scale up the amount of training data by 1) creating bar overlap when splitting an excerpt to be used for network input, and 2) by utilizing MIDI-only data to synthetically create audio-MIDI pair data. We confirmed that 1) the proposed data augmentation methods were highly effective for training generic Transformer models that generate tokenized outputs, 2) our proposed hybrid CTC-Attention model outperforms conventional methods that transcribe guitar performance with tokens, and 3) the addition of multi-task learning with CTC in our proposed model is especially effective when there is an insufficient amount of training data.",

    "description": "In this paper, we address the problem of pitch estimation using self-supervised learning (SSL). The SSL paradigm we use is equivariance to pitch transposition, which enables our model to accurately perform pitch estimation on monophonic audio after being trained only on a small unlabeled dataset. We use a lightweight (< 30k parameters) Siamese neural network that takes as inputs two different pitch-shifted versions of the same audio represented by its constant-Q transform. To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices. We evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications. In particular, our results surpass self-supervised baselines and narrow the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised methods for pitch estimation.",

The article explores the dynamic interaction and exchange of methodologies between musicology and computational music research. It focuses on an analysis of ten years' worth of papers from the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) from 2012 to 2021. Over 1000 citations of ISMIR papers were reviewed, and out of these, 51 later works published in musicological venues drew from the findings of 28 ISMIR papers. Final results reveal that most contributions from ISMIR rarely make their way to musicology or humanities. Nevertheless, the paper highlights four examples of successful knowledge transfers between the fields and discusses best practices for collaborations while addressing potential causes for such disparities. In the epilogue, we address the interlaced origins of the problem as stemming from the language of new media, institutional restrictions, and the inability to engage in multidisciplinary communication.",

    "description": "Supervised music source separation systems using deep learning are trained by minimizing a loss function between pairs of predicted separations and ground-truth isolated sources. However, open datasets comprising isolated sources are few, small, and restricted to a few music styles. At the same time, multi-track datasets with source bleeding are usually found larger in size, and are easier to compile. In this work, we address the task of singing voice separation when the ground-truth signals have bleeding and only the target vocals and the corresponding mixture are available. We train a cold diffusion model on the frequency domain to iteratively transform a mixture into the corresponding vocals with bleeding. Next, we build the final separation masks by clustering spectrogram bins according to their evolution along the transformation steps. We test our approach on a Carnatic music scenario for which solely datasets with bleeding exist, while current research on this repertoire commonly uses source separation models trained solely with Western commercial music. Our evaluation on a Carnatic test set shows that our system improves Spleeter on interference removal and it is competitive in terms of signal distortion. Code is open sourced",

An answer to this question would enable researchers to more deeply understand how people interact with music. Thus, in this paper, we report the results of an online survey involving 302 participants to investigate the influence of 10 musical factors. We also evaluate how a user's personal characteristics (i.e., personality traits and musical sophistication) relate to the importance of each factor for the user. Moreover, we propose and evaluate three factor-based functions that would enable more effectively browsing songs on a music streaming service. The user survey results provide several reusable insights, including the following: (1) for most participants, the melody and singing voice are important factors in judging whether they like a song on first listen; (2) personal characteristics do influence the important factors (e.g., participants who have high openness and are sensitive to beat deviations emphasize melody); and (3) the proposed functions each have a certain level of demand because they enable users to easily find music that fits their tastes. We have released part of the survey results as publicly available data so that other researchers can reproduce the results and analyze the data from their own viewpoints.",

However, the increasing model complexity makes both training and inference computationally expensive. In this paper, we integrate the ideas of transfer learning and feature-based knowledge distillation and systematically investigate using pre-trained audio embeddings as teachers to guide the training of low-complexity student networks. By regularizing the feature space of the student networks with the pre-trained embeddings, the knowledge in the teacher embeddings can be transferred to the students. We use various pre-trained audio embeddings and test the effectiveness of the method on the tasks of musical instrument classification and music auto-tagging. Results show that our method significantly improves the results in comparison to the identical model trained without the teacher's knowledge. This technique can also be combined with classical knowledge distillation approaches to further improve the model's performance.",

    "description": "Modeling the temporal unfolding of musical events and its interpretation in terms of hierarchical relations is a common theme in music theory, cognition, and composition. To faithfully encode such relations, we need an elegant way to represent both the semantics of prolongation, where a single event is elaborated into multiple events, and process, where the connection from one event to another is elaborated into multiple connections. In existing works, trees are used to capture the former and graphs for the latter. Each such model has the potential to either encode relations between events (e.g., an event being a repetition of another), or relations between processes (e.g., two consecutive steps making up a larger skip), but not both together explicitly. To model meaningful relations between musical events and processes and combine the semantic expressiveness of trees and graphs, we propose a structured representation using algebraic datatype (ADT) with dependent type. We demonstrate its applications towards encoding functional interpretations of harmonic progressions, and large scale organizations of key regions. This paper offers two contributions. First, we provide a novel unifying hierarchical framework for musical processes and events. Second, we provide a structured data type encoding such interpretations, which could facilitate computational approaches in music theory and generation.",

First, harmonics in the spectrograms of audio data decay rapidly along the frequency axis. To enhance the model's sensitivity on the trailing harmonics, we modify the Combined Frequency and Periodicity (CFP) representation using discrete z-transform. Second, the vocal and non-vocal segments with extremely short duration are uncommon. To ensure a more stable melody contour, we design a differentiable loss function that prevents the model from predicting such segments. We apply these modifications to several models, including MSNet, FTANet, and a newly introduced model, PianoNet, modified from a piano transcription network.

Lack of boundary modeling in the objective function could lead to segmentation errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named Harana, to jointly detect the labels and boundaries of harmonic regions using neural semi-CRF (conditional random field). In contrast to rule-based scores used in traditional semi-CRF, a neural score function is proposed to incorporate features with more representational power. To improve the robustness of the model to imperfect harmony profiles, we design an additional score component to penalize the match between the candidate harmony label and the absent notes in the music. Quantitative results from our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves segmentation quality as well as frame-level accuracy compared to previous methods.",

A typical and recent approach to this is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music snippets caused by local and global tempo deviations. In this paper, we address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it only requires weakly aligned audio - sheet music pairs, as well as that the recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations between audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method leads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.",

The rubric comprises seven criteria that contribute to a single playability score, representing the overall difficulty of a song. The rubric was created through interviewing and incorporating feedback from guitar teachers and experts. Additionally, we introduce the playability prediction task by adding annotations to a subset of 200 songs from the McGill Billboard dataset, labelled by a guitar expert using the proposed rubric. We use this dataset to weight each rubric criterion for maximal reliability. Finally, we create a rule-based baseline to score each rubric criterion automatically from chord annotations and timings, and compare this baseline against simple deep learning models trained on chord symbols and textual representations of guitar tablature. The rubric, dataset, and baselines lay a foundation for understanding what makes songs easy or difficult for guitar players and how we can use MIR tools to match amateurs with songs closer to their skill level.",

In practice, the boundary conditions may not be known a priori or may not satisfy such strict assumptions. This paper introduces an alignment algorithm called FlexDTW that is designed to handle a wide range of boundary conditions. FlexDTW allows alignment paths to start anywhere on the bottom or left edge of the cost matrix (adjacent to the origin) and to end anywhere on the top or right edge. In order to properly compare paths of very different lengths, we use a goodness measure that normalizes the cumulative path cost by the path length. The key insight of FlexDTW is that the Manhattan length of a path can be computed by simply knowing the starting point of the path, which can be computed recursively during dynamic programming. We artificially generate a suite of 16 benchmarks based on the Chopin Mazurka dataset in order to characterize audio alignment performance under a variety of boundary conditions. We show that FlexDTW has consistently strong performance that is comparable or better than commonly used alignment algorithms, and it is the only system with strong performance in some boundary conditions.",

    "description": "Tablature notation is widely used in popular music to transcribe and share guitar musical content. As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides, hammer-on/pull-off or bends. This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 and a limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.",

    "name": "Self-Similarity-Based and Novelty-Based Loss for Music Structure Analysis",
    "description": "Music Structure Analysis (MSA) is the task aiming at identifying musical segments that compose a music track and possibly label them based on their similarity. In this paper we propose a supervised approach for the task of music boundary detection. In our approach we simultaneously learn features and convolution kernels. For this we jointly optimize - a loss based on the Self-Similarity-Matrix (SSM) obtained with the learned features, denoted by SSM-loss, and - a loss based on the novelty score obtained applying the learned kernels to the estimated SSM, denoted by novelty-loss. We also demonstrate that relative feature learning, through self-attention, is beneficial for the task of MSA. Finally, we compare the performances of our approach to previously proposed approaches on the standard RWC-Pop, and various subsets of SALAMI.",

    "name": "Modeling Harmonic Similarity for Jazz Using Co-occurrence Vectors and the Membrane Area",
    "description": "In jazz, measuring harmonic similarity is complicated by the common practice of reharmonization -- the altering or substitution of chords without fundamentally changing the piece's harmonic identity. This is analogous to natural language processing tasks where synonymous terms can be used interchangeably without significantly modifying the meaning of a text. Our approach to modeling harmonic similarity borrows from NLP techniques, such as distributional semantics, by embedding chords into a vector space using a co-occurrence matrix. We show that the method can robustly detect harmonic similarity between songs, even when reharmonized. The co-occurrence matrix is computed from a corpus of symbolic jazz-chord progressions, and the result is a map from chords into vectors. A song's harmony can then be represented as a piecewise-linear path constructed from the cumulative sum of its chord vectors. For any two songs, their harmonic similarity can be measured as the minimal surface membrane area between their vector paths. Using a dataset of jazz contrafacts, we show that our approach reduces the median rank of matches from 318 to 18 compared to a baseline approach using pitch class vectors.",

    "description": "There has been a persistent lack of publicly accessible data in singing voice research, particularly concerning the diversity of languages and performance styles. In this paper, we introduce SingStyle111, a large studio-quality singing dataset with multiple languages and different singing styles, and present singing style transfer examples. The dataset features 111 songs performed by eight professional singers, spanning 12.8 hours and covering English, Chinese, and Italian. SingStyle111 incorporates different singing styles, such as bel canto opera, Chinese folk singing, pop, jazz, and children. Specifically, 80 songs include at least two distinct singing styles performed by the same singer. All recordings were conducted in professional studios, yielding clean, dry vocal tracks in mono format with a 44.1 kHz sample rate. We have segmented the singing voices into phrases, providing lyrics, performance MIDI, and scores with phoneme-level alignment. We also extracted acoustic features such as Mel-Spectrogram, F0 contour, and loudness curves. This dataset applies to various MIR tasks such as Singing Voice Synthesis, Singing Voice Conversion, Singing Transcription, Score Following, and Lyrics Detection. It is also designed for Singing Style Transfer, including both performance and voice timbre style. We make the dataset freely available for research purposes.

    "description": "Lyric translation plays a pivotal role in amplifying the global resonance of music, bridging cultural divides, and fostering universal connections. Translating lyrics, unlike conventional translation tasks, requires a delicate balance between singability and semantics. In this paper, we present a computational framework for the quantitative evaluation of singable lyric translation, which seamlessly integrates musical, linguistic, and cultural dimensions of lyrics. Our comprehensive framework consists of four metrics that measure syllable count distance, phoneme repetition similarity, musical structure distance, and semantic similarity. To substantiate the efficacy of our framework, we collected a singable lyrics dataset, which precisely aligns English, Japanese, and Korean lyrics on a line-by-line and section-by-section basis, and conducted a comparative analysis between singable and non-singable lyrics. Our multidisciplinary approach provides insights into the key components that underlie the art of lyric translation and establishes a solid groundwork for the future of computational lyric translation assessment.",

    "description": "When people listen to playlists on a music streaming service, they typically listen to each song from start to end in order. However, what if it were possible to use a function to listen to only the choruses of each song in a playlist one after another? In this paper, we call this music listening concept \"chorus-playlist,\" and we investigate its potential impact from various perspectives such as the demand and the objectives for listening to music with chorus-playlist. To this end, we conducted a questionnaire-based online user survey involving 214 participants. Our analysis results suggest reusable insights, including the following: (1) We show a high demand for listening to existing playlists with the chorus-playlist approach. We also reveal preferred options for chorus playback, such as adding crossfade transitions between choruses. (2) People listen to playlists with chorus-playlist for various objectives. For example, when they listen to their own self-made playlists, they want to boost a mood or listen to music in a specific context such as work or driving. (3) There is also a high demand for playlist creation on the premise of continuous listening to only the choruses of the songs in a playlist. The diversities of artists, genres, and moods are more important when creating such a playlist than when creating a usual playlist.",

    "description": "Digital musicology research often proceeds by extending and enriching its evidence base as it progresses, rather than starting with a complete corpus of data and metadata, as a consequence of an emergent research need. In this paper, we consider a research workflow which assumes an incremental approach to data gathering and annotation. We describe tooling which implements parts of this workflow, developed to support the study of nineteenth-century music arrangements, and evaluate the applicability of our approach through interviews with musicologists and music editors who have used the tools. We conclude by considering extensions of this approach and the wider implications for digital musicology and music information retrieval.",

    "description": "This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of existing feature extraction tools for symbolic music and contrasts their performance to determine the set of features that best characterizes the musical style of a given music score. In this regard, we propose a novel feature extraction tool, named musif, and evaluate its efficacy on various repertoires and file formats, including MIDI, MusicXML, and **kern. Musif approximates existing tools such as jSymbolic and music21 in terms of computational efficiency while attempting to enhance the usability for custom feature development. The proposed tool also enhances classification accuracy when combined with other sets of features. We demonstrate the contribution of each set of features and the computational resources they require. Our findings indicate that the optimal tool for feature extraction is a combination of the best features from each tool rather than those of a single one. To facilitate future research in music information retrieval, we release the source code of the tool and benchmarks.",

    "description": "Research in natural language processing has demonstrated that the quality of generations from trained autoregressive language models is significantly influenced by the used sampling strategy. In this study, we investigate the impact of different sampling techniques on musical qualities such as diversity and structure. To accomplish this, we train a high-capacity transformer model on a vast collection of highly-structured Irish folk melodies and analyze the musical qualities of the samples generated using distribution truncation sampling techniques. Specifically, we use nucleus sampling, the recently proposed \"typical sampling\", and conventional ancestral sampling. We evaluate the effect of these sampling strategies in two scenarios: optimal circumstances with a well-calibrated model and suboptimal circumstances where we systematically degrade the model's performance. We assess the generated samples using objective and subjective evaluations. We discover that probability truncation techniques may restrict diversity and structural patterns in optimal circumstances, but may also produce more musical samples in suboptimal circumstances.",

    "name": "Measuring the Eurovision Song Contest: A Living Dataset for Real-World MIR",
    "description": "Every year, several dozen, primarily European, countries, send performers to compete on live television at the Eurovision Song Contest, with the goal of entertaining an international audience of more than 150 million viewers. Each participating country is able to evaluate every other country's performance via a combination of rankings from professional jurors and telephone votes from viewers. Between fan sites and the official Song Contest organisation, a complete historical record of musical performances and country-to-country contest scores is available, back to the very first edition in 1956, and for the most recent contests, there is also information about each individual juror's rankings. In this paper, we introduce MIRoVision, a set of scripts which collates the data from these sources into a single, easy-to-use dataset, and a discrete-choice model to convert the raw contest scores into a stable, interval-scale measure of the quality of Eurovision Song Contest entries across the years. We use this model to simulate contest outcomes from previous editions and compare the results to the implied win probabilities from bookmakers at various online betting markets. We also assess how successful content-based MIR could be at predicting Eurovision outcomes, using state-of-the-art music foundation models. Given its annual recurrence, emphasis on new music and lesser-known artists, and sophisticated voting structure, the Eurovision Song Contest is an outstanding testing ground for MIR algorithms, and we hope that this paper will inspire the community to use the contest as a regular assessment of the strength of modern MIR.",

    "description": "In this work, we address music representation learning using convolution-free transformers. We build on top of existing spectrogram-based audio transformers such as AST and train our models on a supervised task using patchout training similar to PaSST. In contrast to previous works, we study how specific design decisions affect downstream music tagging tasks instead of focusing on the training task. We assess the impact of initializing the training with different existing weights, using various input audio segment lengths, using learned representations from different blocks and tokens of the transformer for downstream tasks, and applying patchout at inference to speed up feature extraction. We find that 1) initializing the audio training from ImageNet or AudioSet weights and longer input segments are beneficial both for the training and downstream tasks, 2) the best representations for the downstream tasks are located in the middle blocks of the transformer, and 3) using patchout at inference allows faster processing than our convolutional baselines while maintaining superior performance. The resulting models, MAEST, are publicly available and obtain the best performance among open models in music tagging tasks.",

    "description": "Deep learning systems have become popular for tackling a variety of music information retrieval tasks. However, these systems often require large amounts of labeled data for supervised training, which can be very costly to obtain. To alleviate this problem, recent papers on learning music audio representations employ alternative training strategies that utilize unannotated data. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-version approach to audio representation learning that can be used with music datasets containing several versions (performances) of a musical work. Our method exploits the correspondences that exist between two versions of the same musical section. We evaluate our proposed cross-version approach qualitatively and quantitatively on complex orchestral music recordings and show that it can better capture aspects of instrumentation compared to techniques that do not use cross-version information.",

    "description": "This paper proposes a new music source separation (MSS) model based on an architecture with MLP-Mixer that leverages multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Most of the recent MSS techniques are based on architectures with CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers that take waveforms or complex spectrograms or both as inputs. For the growth of the research field, we believe it is important to study not only the current established methodologies but also diverse perspectives. Therefore, since the MLP-Mixer-based architecture has been reported to perform as well as or better than architectures with CNNs and transformers in the computer vision field despite the MLP's simple computation, we report a way to effectively apply such an architecture to MSS as a reusable insight. In this paper we propose a model called TFC-MLP, which is a variant of the MLP-Mixer architecture that preserves time-frequency positional relationships and mixes time, frequency, and channel dimensions separately, using complex spectrograms as input. The TFC-MLP was evaluated with source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) using the MUSDB18-HQ dataset. Experimental results showed that the proposed model can achieve competitive SDRs when compared with state-of-the-art MSS models.",

However, symbolic music is neither an image nor a sentence intrinsically, and research in the symbolic domain is lacking a comprehensive overview of the different available representations. In this paper, we investigate matrix (piano roll), sequence, and graph representations and their corresponding neural architectures, in combination with symbolic scores and performances on three piece-level classification tasks. We also introduce a novel graph representation for symbolic performances and explore the capability of graph representations in global classification tasks. Our systematic evaluation shows advantages and limitations of each input representation.",

We then describe the qualities and criteria required to comprehensively and consistently measure displacements between TIVs. Next, we present the Polar Manhattan Displacement (PMD), a compound magnitude and phase measure for describing the displacements between pitch class sets in a tonally-informed manner. We end by providing examples of how PMD can be used in automated harmonic sequence analysis over a complex chord vocabulary.",
